# Improved description of van der Waals interactions

## Introduction

This chapter should be immediately understandable to anyone with an undergrad in physics or chemistry. It gives background:

-   What is the role of vdW interactions in nature and technology: bio, medicine, soft materials, nanomaterials, catalysis
-   What are the fundamental physical laws that vdW interactions arise from and why cannot we simply solve those equations (QED, Schrodinger equation, classical electrodynamics). This serves as motivation.
-   Terminology: What is the relationship to "noncovalent interactions" and "dispersion", Feynman picture
-   What are the common, basic approximations used in this field: relativity, Born-Oppenheimer, temperature

## Electronic many-body problem

-   Many-body electronic Schrodinger equation
-   Mean-field theories – one-electron picture
-   Pair correlation functions, correlation, Pauli principle, exchange
-   Dynamic vs static correlation, strong/weak, short-range/long-range
-   Correlated wave function vs. correlation energy, variational principle, self-consistency
-   QMC
-   Hartre–Fock, quantum chemistry
-   Density functional theory
-   Adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem
-   Range separation

## Long-range electron correlation

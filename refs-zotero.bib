  title = {Accurate Description of van der {{Waals}} Complexes by Density Functional Theory Including Empirical Corrections},
  volume = {25},
  doi = {10.1002/jcc.20078},
  abstract = {An empirical method to account for van der Waals interactions in practical calculations with the density functional theory (termed DFT-D) is tested for a wide variety of molecular complexes. As in previous schemes, the dispersive energy is described by damped interatomic potentials of the form C6R-6. The use of pure, gradient-corrected density functionals (BLYP and PBE), together with the resolution-of-the-identity (RI) approximation for the Coulomb operator, allows very efficient computations for large systems. Opposed to previous work, extended AO basis sets of polarized TZV or QZV quality are employed, which reduces the basis set superposition error to a negligible extend. By using a global scaling factor for the atomic C6 coefficients, the functional dependence of the results could be strongly reduced. The ``double counting'' of correlation effects for strongly bound complexes is found to be insignificant if steep damping functions are employed. The method is applied to a total of 29 complexes of atoms and small molecules (Ne, CH4, NH3, H2O, CH3F, N2, F2, formic acid, ethene, and ethine) with each other and with benzene, to benzene, naphthalene, pyrene, and coronene dimers, the naphthalene trimer, coronene $\cdot$ H2O and four H-bonded and stacked DNA base pairs (AT and GC). In almost all cases, very good agreement with reliable theoretical or experimental results for binding energies and intermolecular distances is obtained. For stacked aromatic systems and the important base pairs, the DFT-D-BLYP model seems to be even superior to standard MP2 treatments that systematically overbind. The good results obtained suggest the approach as a practical tool to describe the properties of many important van der Waals systems in chemistry. Furthermore, the DFT-D data may either be used to calibrate much simpler (e.g., force-field) potentials or the optimized structures can be used as input for more accurate ab initio calculations of the interaction energies. \textcopyright{} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  title = {Empirical Correction to Density Functional Theory for van der {{Waals}} Interactions},
  volume = {116},
  doi = {10.1063/1.1424928},
  abstract = {An empirical method has been designed to account for the van der Waals interactions in practical molecular calculations with density functional theory. For each atom pair separated at a distance R, the method adds to the density functionalelectronic structure calculations an additional attraction energy E vdW =-f d (R)C 6 R -6 , where f d (R) is the damping function which equals to one at large value of R and zero at small value of R. The coefficients C 6 for pair interactions between hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms have been developed in this work by a least-square fitting to the molecular C 6 coefficients obtained from the dipole oscillator strength distribution method by Meath and co-workers. Two forms of the damping functions have been studied, with one dropping to zero at short distances much faster than the other. Four density functionals have been examined: Becke's three parameter hybrid functional with the Lee-Yang-Parr correlation functional, Becke's 1988 exchange functional with the LYP correlation functional, Becke's 1988 exchange functional with Perdew and Wang's 1991 (PW91) correlation functional, and PW91 exchange and correlation functional. The method has been applied to three systems where the van der Waals attractions are known to be important: rare-gas diatomic molecules, stacking of base pairs and polyalanines' conformation stabilities. The results show that this empirical method, with the damping function dropping to zero smoothly, provides a significant correction to both of the Becke's hybrid functional and the PW91 exchange and correlation functional. Results are comparable to the corresponding second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset calculations in many cases.},

We apply this approximate DFT plus dispersion energy method to describe the hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions of nucleic acid base pairs.

  abstract = {Noncovalent van der Waals (vdW) or dispersion forces are ubiquitous in nature and influence the structure, stability, dynamics, and function of molecules and materials throughout chemistry, biology, physics, and materials science. These forces are quantum mechanical in origin and arise from electrostatic interactions between fluctuations in the electronic charge density. Here, we explore the conceptual and mathematical ingredients required for an exact treatment of vdW interactions, and present a systematic and unified framework for classifying the current first-principles vdW methods based on the adiabatic-connection fluctuation\textendash{}dissipation (ACFD) theorem (namely the Rutgers\textendash{}Chalmers vdW-DF, Vydrov\textendash{}Van Voorhis (VV), exchange-hole dipole moment (XDM), Tkatchenko\textendash{}Scheffler (TS), many-body dispersion (MBD), and random-phase approximation (RPA) approaches). Particular attention is paid to the intriguing nature of many-body vdW interactions, whose fundamental relevance has recently been highlighted in several landmark experiments. The performance of these models in predicting binding energetics as well as structural, electronic, and thermodynamic properties is connected with the theoretical concepts and provides a numerical summary of the state-of-the-art in the field. We conclude with a roadmap of the conceptual, methodological, practical, and numerical challenges that remain in obtaining a universally applicable and truly predictive vdW method for realistic molecular systems and materials.},

Such a theory is especially important when considering vdW interactions at mesoscopic scales, i.e., between molecules and structured surfaces with features on the scale of molecular sizes, in which case the finite sizes, complex shapes, and resulting nonlocal electronic excitations of molecules are strongly influenced by electromagnetic retardation and wave effects that depend crucially on the shapes of surrounding macroscopic bodies. We show that these effects together can modify vdW interaction energies and forces, as well as molecular shapes deformed by vdW interactions, by orders of magnitude compared to previous treatments based on Casimir-Polder, nonretarded, or pairwise approximations, which are valid only at macroscopically large or atomic-scale separations or in dilute insulating media, respectively.},

  abstract = {A calculation of van der Waal's potential of two atoms at large separation has been carried out for hydrogen and helium. The method depends upon a representation of the perturbed wave function of the system as $\psi$=$\psi$0 (1+vR) where $\psi$0 is the unperturbed wave function, v the perturbing potential and R is a function of the radial coordinates of the electrons. The method is equally well adapted to the calculation of polarizabilities. A computation of the mutual energy of two hydrogen atoms confirms the results of Eisenschitz and London. The polarizability of helium is calculated as 0.210\texttimes{}10-24 cc which agrees well with the experimental value, 0.205\texttimes{}10-24. The mutual energy of two helium atoms is found to be -3.18 E0(Ra0)6. A correlation between the mutual energy of the two molecules, $\epsilon$, and the polarizability, $\alpha$, is obtained: $\epsilon$=-1.36$\nu$012a032a32E0R6 where $\nu$0 is the number of electrons in the highest quantum state in the molecule, E0 the energy of the hydrogen atom in the normal state, and R is the separation of the molecules. By means of this formula, the van der Waals cohesive pressure constant is calculated for Ne, A, N2, H2, O2, and CH4.},

  doi = {10.1103/PhysRev.73.360},
  abstract = {The influence of retardation on the energy of interaction between two neutral atoms is investigated by means of quantum electrodynamics. As a preliminary step, Part I contains a discussion of the interaction between a neutral atom and a perfectly conducting plane, and it is found that the influence of retardation leads to a reduction of the interaction energy by a correction factor which decreases monotonically with increasing distance R. This factor is equal to unity for R small compared with the wave-lengths corresponding to the atomic frequencies, and is proportional to R-1 for distances large compared with these wave-lengths. In the latter case the total interaction energy is given by -3$\hslash$c$\alpha$8$\uppi$R4, where $\alpha$ is the static polarizability of the atom. Although the problem of the interaction of two atoms discussed in Part II is much more difficult to handle mathematically, the results are very similar. Again the influence of retardation can be described by a monotonically decreasing correction factor which is equal to unity for small distances and proportional to R-1 for large distances. In the latter case the energy of interaction is found to be -23$\hslash$c$\alpha$1$\alpha$24$\uppi$R7.},

  abstract = {A direct measurement has been made of the forces in air between two cylindrical sheets of mica arranged with their axes mutually at right angles. The contact resembles that between a sphere and a flat. The mica sheets are glued to glass formers, their concave face being first slightly silvered. The contact region and the distance of approach are measured by multiple beam interferometry using fringes of equal chromatic order (f. e. c. o.). This gives an accuracy for the distances between the surfaces of $\pm$ 0.3 nm. Since the surfaces are molecularly smooth it is possible to bring them very close to one another. One surface is held on a rigid support, the other on a light cantilever beam. The surfaces are slowly brought together and at a critical separation `flick' together. The `flick' distance depends on the stiffness of the cantilever and this in turn provides a direct measure of the surface forces. By using cantilevers of different stiffnesses the method has proved effective for separations ranging from 5 to 30 nm. The results show that for separations less than about 10 nm the forces operating are `normal' van der Waals forces whilst for distances greater than 20 nm they are `retarded' van der Waals forces.},

  volume = {103},
  doi = {10.1021/jp991641n},
  abstract = {An intermolecular potential was derived from ab initio calculations on methanol dimers and trimers. Ninety-four methanol dimer geometries and seventeen trimer geometries have been studied using an interaction-optimized basis set. Because we aimed at transferability, all terms of the model were fitted separately, in order to obtain a potential in which these energy terms have a well-defined physical meaning. Electrostatic interactions were described by atomic multipole moments obtained by fitting to the monomer electrostatic potential. The polarization energy was modeled using atomic dipole polarizabilities. Scaled empirical polarizabilities reproduced the energy nonadditivity in methanol trimers very accurately. The dispersion energy was described by a damped r-6 atom-atom potential, which was fitted to separately calculated dispersion energies. Exchange energy and remaining short-ranged terms were modeled by an exponential repulsion term, including some anisotropic features. This repulsion model was fitted to the total SCF+MP2 interaction energies of the dimers. The maximum deviation for near-equilibrium geometries was $\sim$0.2 kcal/mol. The calculated interaction energies for dimers containing methane, water, and dimethyl ether were in similar agreement, both with our own ab initio calculations and with the best values available in the literature. In addition, trends in hydrogen-bond distances in these dimers and in methanol trimers were well reproduced by our model. So, the potential was seen to be transferable to related systems.},

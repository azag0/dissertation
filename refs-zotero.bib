  abstract = {Noncovalent interactions are ubiquitous in molecular and condensed-phase environments, and hence a reliable theoretical description of these fundamental interactions could pave the way toward a more complete understanding of the microscopic underpinnings for a diverse set of systems in chemistry and biology. In this work, we demonstrate that recent algorithmic advances coupled to the availability of large-scale computational resources make the stochastic quantum Monte Carlo approach to solving the Schr{\"o}dinger equation an optimal contender for attaining ?chemical accuracy? (1 kcal/mol) in the binding energies of supramolecular complexes of chemical relevance. To illustrate this point, we considered a select set of seven host?guest complexes, representing the spectrum of noncovalent interactions, including dispersion or van der Waals forces, $\uppi$?$\uppi$ stacking, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and electrostatic (ion?dipole) attraction. A detailed analysis of the interaction energies reveals that a complete theoretical description necessitates treatment of terms well beyond the standard London and Axilrod?Teller contributions to the van der Waals dispersion energy.},

  abstract = {Interactions involving aromatic rings are important in molecular/biomolecular assembly and engineering. As a consequence, there have been a number of investigations on dimers involving benzene or other substituted $\uppi$ systems. In this Feature Article, we examine the relevance of the magnitudes of their attractive and repulsive interaction energy components in governing the geometries of several $\uppi$?$\uppi$ systems. The geometries and the associated binding energies were evaluated at the complete basis set (CBS) limit of coupled cluster theory with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples excitations [CCSD(T)] using a least biased scheme for the given data set. The results for the benzene dimer indicate that the floppy T-shaped structure (center-to-center distance:? 4.96 {\AA}, with an axial benzene off-centered above the facial benzene) is isoenergetic in zero-point-energy (ZPE) corrected binding energy (D0) to the displaced-stacked structure (vertical interplanar distance:? 3.54 {\AA}). However, the T-shaped structure is likely to be slightly more stable (D0 $\approx$ 2.4?2.5 kcal/mol) if quadruple excitations are included in the coupled cluster calculations. The presence of substituents on the aromatic ring, irrespective of their electron withdrawing or donating nature, leads to an increase in the binding energy, and the displaced-stacked conformations are more stabilized than the T-shaped conformers. This explains the wide prevalence of displaced stacked structures in organic crystals. Despite that the dispersion energy is dominating, the substituent as well as the conformational effects are correlated to the electrostatic interaction. This electrostatic origin implies that the substituent effect would be reduced in polar solution, but important in apolar media, in particular, for assembling processes.},

In addition to components which are the ordinary longitudinal and transverse dielectric constants, there are components which couple transverse and longitudinal electromagnetic disturbances. A formalism for calculating the local-field corrections to the dielectric constant is developed in detail for the case of the longitudinal dielectric constant of a cubic insulating solid. In the coarsest (dipole) approximation, the theory gives a Lorenz-Lorentz formula modified by self-polarization corrections arising from the polarization of the charge in a unit cell by its own field.},

In the model the field due to the instantaneous polarization of one molecule polarizes the second molecule nonlocally, thereby producing a reaction field that acts on the first molecule. The resulting energy change depends upon the averaged product of the fluctuatingpolarization at different points in the first molecule; by the fluctuation\textendash{}dissipationtheorem, this product is related to the imaginary part of the nonlocal polarizability density. The model gives the van der Waals energy as an integral of a contracted tensor product of two dipole propagators and the imaginary-frequency nonlocal polarizabilities of the interacting molecules. The validity of the model is established by comparison with results from second-order perturbation theory.},

  abstract = {The host\textendash{}guest complexes formed with [6]cycloparaphenyleneacetylene ([6]CPPA) and its anthracene-containing derivative ([6]CPPAs) hosts and fullerene C70 guest were explored by density functional calculations. Besides two previously reported configurations in which C70 guest is standing or lying in the cavity of the host, we found a new kind of configuration in which C70 guest is half-lying in the cavity of the host. More interestingly, the calculated results revealed that the fine-tuning deformations occur readily during the formations of the complexes, suggesting that both [6]CPPA and [6]CPPAs are highly elastic host molecules. The large host\textendash{}guest binding energies indicate that both two host molecules, [6]CPPA and [6]CPPAs, have excellent encapsulation ability for C70 guest, and the [6]CPPAs even has much better encapsulation ability for C70 than [6]CPPA. Furthermore, the host\textendash{}guest interactions regions were detected and visualized in real space based on the electron density and reduced density gradient. Additionally, 1H NMR spectra of those three different kinds of configurations mentioned earlier have been calculated with gage-independent atomic orbital method, which may be helpful for further experimental characterizations in future.

  abstract = {Treating both many-body polarization and dispersion interactions is now recognized as a key element in achieving the level of atomistic modeling required to reveal novel physics in complex systems. The quantum Drude oscillator (QDO), a Gaussian-based, coarse grained electronic structure model, captures both many-body polarization and dispersion and has linear scale computational complexity with system size, hence it is a leading candidate next-generation simulation method. Here, we investigate the extent to which the QDO treatment reproduces the desired long-range atomic and molecular properties. We present closed form expressions for leading order polarizabilities and dispersion coefficients and derive invariant (parameter-free) scaling relationships among multipole polarizability and many-body dispersion coefficients that arise due to the Gaussian nature of the model. We show that these ``combining rules'' hold to within a few percent for noble gas atoms, alkali metals, and simple (first-row hydride) molecules such as water; this is consistent with the surprising success that models with underlying Gaussian statistics often exhibit in physics. We present a diagrammatic Jastrow-type perturbation theory tailored to the QDO model that serves to illustrate the rich types of responses that the QDO approach engenders. QDO models for neon, argon, krypton, and xenon, designed to reproduce gas phase properties, are constructed and their condensed phase properties explored via linear scale diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations. Good agreement with experimental data for structure, cohesive energy, and bulk modulus is found, demonstrating a degree of transferability that cannot be achieved using current empirical models or fully ab initio descriptions.},

  doi = {10.1063/1.4865104},
  abstract = {An accurate determination of the electron correlation energy is an essential prerequisite for describing the structure, stability, and function in a wide variety of systems. Therefore, the development of efficient approaches for the calculation of the correlation energy (and hence the dispersion energy as well) is essential and such methods can be coupled with many density-functional approximations, local methods for the electron correlation energy, and even interatomic force fields. In this work, we build upon the previously developed many-body dispersion (MBD) framework, which is intimately linked to the random-phase approximation for the correlation energy. We separate the correlation energy into short-range contributions that are modeled by semi-local functionals and long-range contributions that are calculated by mapping the complex all-electron problem onto a set of atomic response functions coupled in the dipole approximation. We propose an effective range-separation of the coupling between the atomic response functions that extends the already broad applicability of the MBD method to non-metallic materials with highly anisotropic responses, such as layered nanostructures. Application to a variety of high-quality benchmark datasets illustrates the accuracy and applicability of the improved MBD approach, which offers the prospect of first-principles modeling of large structurally complex systems with an accurate description of the long-range correlation energy.},

The conformational preferences of the ten possible base-pair steps in double-helical DNA have been calculated and compared with experimental data from X-ray fibre diffraction, X-ray cystal structures and gel-running experiments. The calculations account for many features of sequence-dependent DNA structure, including polymorphism in DNA, the lack of polymorphism in RNA, the structure of Z-DNA, bistability in pyrimidine-purine (YR) steps, the origin of propeller twist and buckle and the role of TATA sequences at the sites of origin of replication.

The computational model specifically allows for the charge distribution associated with the out-of-plane $\uppi$-electron density of the bases. The results obtained are rationalized on the basis of the shapes and charge distributions of the bases.

Calladine's cross-strand steric clashes at pyrimidine-purine (YR) and CX/XG steps are reproduced. In AX/XT steps, same-strand steric clashes occur between the thymine methyl group and the 5${'}$-neighbouring sugar. They are the cause of the large negative propeller twist observed in A$\cdot$T base-pairs. Steric clashes between the thymine methyl group and the 5${'}$-neighbouring base block A-DNA conformations in AX/XT steps.

Electrostatic interactions between partial stomic charges are most important for C$\cdot$G base-pairs which are highly polarized. They lead to strong preferences for positive slide and negative slide conformations in CG and GC steps, respectively. This combination can be accommodated in poly(CG) by left-handed Z-DNA. Many of the more subtle sequence-dependent effects are caused by electrostatic interactions between the partial atomic charges on one base-pair and the out-of-plane $\uppi$-electron density on another. The effect is most important in CX-XG steps and leads to bistability. In general, electrostatic interactions cause non-zero slide. This is opposed by the hydrophobic effect which favours the zero slide B-type conformation. Thus, B-DNA is observed at high water content in fibres and electrostatic interactions force high or low slide A or C-DNA conformations at low water content.

If two juxtaposed steps have very different conformational preferences, this incompatibility can lead to unusual structures such as Z-DNA or strain such as in TATA sequences.},

These stochastic wave-function-based approaches provide a very direct treatment of quantum many-body effects and serve as benchmarks against which other techniques may be compared. They complement the less demanding density-functional approach by providing more accurate results and a deeper understanding of the physics of electronic correlation in real materials. The algorithms are intrinsically parallel, and currently available high-performance computers allow applications to systems containing a thousand or more electrons. With these tools one can study complicated problems such as the properties of surfaces and defects, while including electron correlation effects with high precision. The authors provide a pedagogical overview of the techniques and describe a selection of applications to ground and excited states of solids and clusters.},

Several approximations have been proposed to add a vdW correction to the DFT total energies (Stefan Grimme (D2 and D3) with different damping functions (D3-BJ), Tkatchenko\textendash{}Scheffler (TS) without and with self-consistent screening (TS + SCS) effects). Those corrections have remarkly improved the agreement between our results and experiment for the interlayer distance (from 3.8 to 0.1\%) and high-level random-phase approximation (RPA) calculations for interlayer binding energy (from 56.2 to 0.6\%). We report a systematic investigation of various structural, energetic and electron properties with the aforementioned vdW corrections followed by comparison with experimental and theoretical RPA data. Comparison between the resulting relative errors shows that the TS + SCS correction provides the best results; the other corrections yield significantly larger errors for at least one of the studied properties. If considerations of computational costs or convergence problems rule out the TS + SCS approach, we recommend the D3-BJ correction.

  doi = {10.1063/1.3521268},
  abstract = {It is known that ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations of liquid water at ambient conditions, based on the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to density functional theory (DFT), with commonly used functionals fail to produce structural and diffusive properties in reasonable agreement with experiment. This is true for canonical, constant temperature simulations where the density of the liquid is fixed to the experimental density. The equilibrium density, at ambient conditions, of DFT water has recently been shown by Schmidt et al. [J. Phys. Chem. B, 113, 11959 (2009)] to be underestimated by different GGA functionals for exchange and correlation, and corrected by the addition of interatomic pair potentials to describe van der Waals (vdW) interactions. In this contribution we present a DFT-AIMD study of liquid water using several GGA functionals as well as the van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) of Dion et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. As expected, we find that the density of water is grossly underestimated by GGA functionals. When a vdW-DF is used, the density improves drastically and the experimental diffusivity is reproduced without the need of thermal corrections. We analyze the origin of the density differences between all the functionals. We show that the vdW-DF increases the population of non-H-bonded interstitial sites, at distances between the first and second coordination shells. However, it excessively weakens the H-bond network, collapsing the second coordination shell. This structural problem is partially associated to the choice of GGA exchange in the vdW-DF. We show that a different choice for the exchange functional is enough to achieve an overall improvement both in structure and diffusivity.},

The properties and the ensuing function of such hybrid interfaces often depend exponentially on molecular adsorption heights and binding strengths, calling for well-established benchmarks of these two quantities. Here we present systematic measurements that enable us to quantify the interaction of benzene with the Ag(111) coinage metal substrate with unprecedented accuracy (0.02 {\AA} in the vertical adsorption height and 0.05 eV in the binding strength) by means of normal-incidence x-ray standing waves and temperature-programed desorption techniques. Based on these accurate experimental benchmarks for a prototypical molecule-solid interface, we demonstrate that recently developed first-principles calculations that explicitly account for the nonlocality of electronic exchange and correlation effects are able to determine the structure and stability of benzene on the Ag(111) surface within experimental error bars. Remarkably, such precise experiments and calculations demonstrate that despite different electronic properties of copper, silver, and gold, the binding strength of benzene is equal on the (111) surface of these three coinage metals. Our results suggest the existence of universal binding energy trends for aromatic molecules on surfaces.},

We show that functionals with the correct -1/r tail of the exchange potential yield superior accuracy for weak interactions. Thus, balancing long-range exchange with dispersion interactions in XDM is essential in the correct description of dimers with significant non-dispersion contributions to binding. With the exception of the noble gases, the performance of PW86PBE-XDM is improved upon at the semilocal (BLYP), hybrid (B3LYP), and range-separated hybrid (LC-$\omega$PBE) levels.

In this work we extend the RPA by including a parameter-free renormalized version of the adiabatic local-density (ALDA) exchange-correlation kernel. The renormalization consists of a (local) truncation of the ALDA kernel for wave vectors q$>$2kF, which is found to yield excellent results for the homogeneous electron gas. In addition, the kernel significantly improves both the absolute correlation energies and atomization energies of small molecules over RPA and ALDA. The renormalization can be straightforwardly applied to other adiabatic local kernels.},

Correlation energies are evaluated using an iterative procedure to compute the eigenvalues of dielectric matrices, which eliminates the computation of unoccupied electronic states. Our results for the structural and binding properties of solid benzene are in very good agreement with experimental results and show that the framework adopted here is a very promising one to investigate molecular crystals and other condensed systems bound by dispersion forces.},

A general and natural choice is to share the charge density at each point among the several atoms in proportion to their free-atom densities at the corresponding distances from the nuclei.

Integration of the atomic deformation densities \textemdash{} bonded minus free atoms \textemdash{} defines net atomic charges and multipole moments which concisely summarize the molecular charge reorganization. They permit calculation of the external electrostatic potential and of the interaction energy between molecules or between parts of the same molecule.

  doi = {10.1063/1.447150},
  abstract = {Starting from our earlier model [J. Chem. Phys. 6 6, 1496 (1977)] a simple expression is derived for the radial dependent damping functions for the individual dispersion coefficients C 2n for arbitrary even orders 2n. The damping functions are only a function of the Born\textendash{}Mayer range parameter b and thus can be applied to all systems for which this is known or can be estimated. For H(1S)\textendash{}H(1S) the results are in almost perfect agreement with the very accurate recent a b i n i t i o damping functions of Koide, Meath, and Allnatt. Comparisons with less accurate previous calculations for other systems also show a satisfactory agreement. By adding a Born\textendash{}Mayer repulsive term [A exp(-b R)] to the damped dispersion potential, a simple universal expression is obtained for the well region of the atom\textendash{}atom van der Waals potential with only five essential parameters A, b, C 6, C 8, and C 1 0. The model has been tested for the following representative systems: H2 3$\Sigma$, He2, and Ar2 as well as NaK 3$\Sigma$ and LiHg, which include four chemically different types of van der Waals interactions for which either very precise theoretical or experimental data is available. For each system the a b i n i t i o dispersion coefficients together with the well-known parameters $\epsilon$ and R m were used to determine A and b from the model potential. With these values the reduced potentials were calculated and found to agree with the experimental potentials to better than 1\% and always less than the experimental uncertainties. Some of the implications of the new model are discussed.},

However, unexpectedly large effects were found in the binding energies, distances, and electrostatic moments of highly polarizable alkali-metal dimers. Most importantly, vdW interactions induced complex and sizable electronic charge redistribution in the vicinity of metallic surfaces and at organic-metal interfaces. As a result, a substantial influence on the computed work functions was found, revealing a nontrivial connection between electrostatics and long-range electron correlation effects.},

  abstract = {The nonlocal polarizability density $\alpha$(r,r';$\omega$) gives the polarization induced at a point r in a quantum mechanical system, due to a perturbing field of frequency $\omega$ that acts at the point r', within linear response; thus it reflects the distribution of polarizability in the system. In order to gain information about the nature and functional form of $\alpha$(r,r';$\omega$), in this work we analyze the nonlocal polarizability density of a well-characterized system, a homogeneous electron gas at zero temperature. We establish a connection between the static, longitudinal component of the nonlocal polarizability density in position space and the dielectric function $\epsilon$(k,0), and then use the connection to obtain results at three levels of approximation to $\epsilon$(k,0): We compare the Thomas\textendash{}Fermi (TF), random phase approximation (RPA), and Vashishta\textendash{}Singwi (VS) forms. At TF level, we evaluate the nonlocal polarizability density analytically, while within the RPA we obtain asymptotic analytical results. The RPA and VS results are similar, and qualitatively distinct from the TF results, which diverge as $\Vert$r-r'$\Vert$ approaches zero. Within the RPA, we find two long-range components in $\alpha$ L (r,r';0): The first is a monotonically decreasing component that arises from charge screening in the electron gas, and varies as $\Vert$r-r'$\Vert$-3; the second is an oscillatory component with terms of order $\Vert$r-r'$\Vert$-n (n$\geq$3) associated with Friedel oscillations in the electron density. These results indicate the possibility of long-range, intramolecular terms in the nonlocal polarizability densities of individual molecules.},

There are, however, effects that are not captured in this way, including surprising dependences of the dispersion energy on the number N of atoms and on separation D. Higher level quantum chemical, perturbative, and random-phase approximation (RPA)-like theories can capture these beyond pairwise effects, but at a high computational cost. Very recent simplified RPA-like approaches based on localized oscillators account for the unusual N dependence in a computationally efficient way. To proceed further, the present work proposes three physically distinct categories of nonpairwise effects (types A, B, and C) against which the performance of existing and future theories can be assessed. \textcopyright{} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Superposition of de Broglie matter waves has been observed for massive particles such as electrons, atoms and dimers, small van der Waals clusters, and neutrons. But matter wave interferometry with larger objects has remained experimentally challenging, despite the development of powerful atom interferometric techniques for experiments in fundamental quantum mechanics, metrology and lithography. Here we report the observation of de Broglie wave interference of C60 molecules by diffraction at a material absorption grating. This molecule is the most massive and complex object in which wave behaviour has been observed. Of particular interest is the fact that C60 is almost a classical body, because of its many excited internal degrees of freedom and their possible couplings to the environment. Such couplings are essential for the appearance of decoherence, suggesting that interference experiments with large molecules should facilitate detailed studies of this process.},

  abstract = {The development of new functionals and methods to accurately describe van der Waals forces in density functional theory (DFT) has become popular in recent years, with the vast majority of studies assessing the accuracy of the energetics of collections of molecules, and to a lesser extent molecular crystalline systems. As the energies are a function of the atom positions, we assess the accuracy of DFT calculations from both a geometric and energetics point of view for the C21 reference data set of Otero-de-la-Roza and Johnson for molecular crystals, and a set of monosaccharide molecular crystals. In particular, we examine the performance of exchange-correlation functionals designed to handle van der Waals forces, including the vdW-DF, vdW-DF2, and XDM methods. We also assess the effect of using small and large basis sets, the choice of basis functions (local atomic orbitals using the SIESTA code versus planewaves using the Quantum ESPRESSO code), and the effect of corrections for basis set superposition errors. Finally, we examine the geometries and energies of the S22 reference set of molecular complexes. Overall, the most accurate geometries for both choices of basis functions are obtained with the vdW-DF2 functional, while the most accurate lattice energies are obtained using vdW-DF2 with local atomic orbitals and XDM with planewaves with mean absolute errors of less than 4 kJ/mol.},

This article explains why local and semilocal approximations work for the exchange-correlation energy. We demonstrate the high accuracy of the local spin-density (LSD) approximation for the on-top pair density, which provides the missing link between real atoms and molecules and the uniform electron gas. Special attention is devoted to the leading correction to exchange in the high-density (or weakly correlated) limit. We give an improved analytic expression for the on-top pair density in the uniform electron gas, calculating its spin-polarization dependence exactly in the high-density limit. We find the exact form of the gradient expansion for the on-top pair density, using Levy's scaling of the interactingwave function. We also discuss the importance of system averaging, which unweights spatial regions where the density varies most rapidly. We show how the depth of the on-top hole correlates with the degree of locality of the exchange-correlation energy. Finally, we discuss how well fully nonlocal approximations (weighted-density, self-interaction correction, and hybrid-exchange) reproduce the on-top hole.},

  abstract = {First-principles derivation is given for the heuristic exchange-hole model of London dispersion forces by Becke and Johnson [J. Chem. Phys.122, 154104 (2005)]. A one-term approximation is used for the dynamic charge density response function, and it is shown that a central nonempirical ingredient of the approximate nonexpanded dispersion energy is the charge density autocorrelation function, a two-particle property, related to the exchange-correlation hole. In the framework of a dipolar approximation of the Coulomb interaction around the molecular origin, one obtains the so-called Salem-Tang-Karplus approximation to the C 6 dispersion coefficient. Alternatively, by expanding the Coulomb interaction around the center of charge (centroid) of the exchange-correlation hole associated with each point in the molecular volume, a multicenter expansion is obtained around the centroids of electron localization domains, always in terms of the exchange-correlation hole. In order to get a formula analogous to that of Becke and Johnson, which involves the exchange-hole only, further assumptions are needed, related to the difficulties of obtaining the expectation value of a two-electron operator from a single determinant. Thus a connection could be established between the conventional fluctuating charge densitymodel of London dispersion forces and the notion of the ``exchange-hole dipole moment'' shedding some light on the true nature of the approximations implicit in the Becke-Johnson model.},

  abstract = {We present a comparative assessment of the accuracy of two different approaches for evaluating dispersion interactions: interatomic pairwise corrections and semiempirical meta-generalized-gradient-approximation (meta-GGA)-based functionals. This is achieved by employing conventional (semi)local and (screened-)hybrid functionals, as well as semiempirical hybrid and nonhybrid meta-GGA functionals of the M06 family, with and without interatomic pairwise Tkatchenko?Scheffler corrections. All of those are tested against the benchmark S22 set of weakly bound systems, a representative larger molecular complex (dimer of NiPc molecules), and a representative dispersively bound solid (hexagonal boron nitride). For the S22 database, we also compare our results with those obtained from the pairwise correction of Grimme (DFT-D3) and nonlocal Langreth?Lundqvist functionals (vdW-DF1 and vdW-DF2). We find that the semiempirical kinetic-energy-density dependence introduced in the M06 functionals mimics some of the nonlocal correlation needed to describe dispersion. However, long-range contributions are still missing. Pair-wise interatomic corrections, applied to conventional semilocal or hybrid functionals, or to M06 functionals, provide for a satisfactory level of accuracy irrespectively of the underlying functional. Specifically, screened-hybrid functionals such as the Heyd?Scuseria?Ernzerhof (HSE) approach reduce self-interaction errors in systems possessing both localized and delocalized orbitals and can be applied to both finite and extended systems. Therefore, they serve as a useful underlying functional for dispersion corrections.},

  abstract = {With numerous new quantum chemistry methods being developed in recent years and the promise of even more new methods to be developed in the near future, it is clearly critical that highly accurate, well-balanced, reference data for many different atomic and molecular properties be available for the parametrization and validation of these methods. One area of research that is of particular importance in many areas of chemistry, biology, and material science is the study of noncovalent interactions. Because these interactions are often strongly influenced by correlation effects, it is necessary to use computationally expensive high-order wave function methods to describe them accurately. Here, we present a large new database of interaction energies calculated using an accurate CCSD(T)/CBS scheme. Data are presented for 66 molecular complexes, at their reference equilibrium geometries and at 8 points systematically exploring their dissociation curves; in total, the database contains 594 points: 66 at equilibrium geometries, and 528 in dissociation curves. The data set is designed to cover the most common types of noncovalent interactions in biomolecules, while keeping a balanced representation of dispersion and electrostatic contributions. The data set is therefore well suited for testing and development of methods applicable to bioorganic systems. In addition to the benchmark CCSD(T) results, we also provide decompositions of the interaction energies by means of DFT-SAPT calculations. The data set was used to test several correlated QM methods, including those parametrized specifically for noncovalent interactions. Among these, the SCS-MI-CCSD method outperforms all other tested methods, with a root-mean-square error of 0.08 kcal/mol for the S66 data set.},

A balanced treatment of other energetic contributions, such as exchange, is crucial if we aim for accurate description of various properties of weakly bound systems. In this paper, the vdW-DF correlation functional is modified to make it better compatible with accurate exchange functionals. We suggest a slightly simplified construction of the nonlocal correlation, yielding more accurate asymptotic C(6) coefficients. We also derive a gradient correction, containing a parameter that can be adjusted to suit an exchange functional of choice.

  doi = {10.1007/s00214-011-1084-8},
  abstract = {In the past decade, the random phase approximation (RPA) has emerged as a promising post-Kohn\textendash{}Sham method to treat electron correlation in molecules, surfaces, and solids. In this review, we explain how RPA arises naturally as a zero-order approximation from the adiabatic connection and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem in a density functional context. This is contrasted to RPA with exchange (RPAX) in a post-Hartree\textendash{}Fock context. In both methods, RPA and RPAX, the correlation energy may be expressed as a sum over zero-point energies of harmonic oscillators representing collective electronic excitations, consistent with the physical picture originally proposed by Bohm and Pines. The extra factor 1/2 in the RPAX case is rigorously derived. Approaches beyond RPA are briefly summarized. We also review computational strategies implementing RPA. The combination of auxiliary expansions and imaginary frequency integration methods has lead to recent progress in this field, making RPA calculations affordable for systems with over 100 atoms. Finally, we summarize benchmark applications of RPA to various molecular and solid-state properties, including relative energies of conformers, reaction energies involving weak and covalent interactions, diatomic potential energy curves, ionization potentials and electron affinities, surface adsorption energies, bulk cohesive energies and lattice constants. RPA barrier heights for an extended benchmark set are presented. RPA is an order of magnitude more accurate than semi-local functionals such as B3LYP for non-covalent interactions rivaling the best empirically parametrized methods. Larger but systematic errors are observed for processes that do not conserve the number of electron pairs, such as atomization and ionization.},

  abstract = {The nonlocal correlation functional VV10, developed recently in our group, describes the whole range of dispersion interactions in a seamless and general fashion using only the electron density as input. The VV10 functional has a simple analytic form that can be adjusted for pairing with the exchange functional of choice. In this paper, we use several benchmark data sets of weakly interacting molecular complexes to test the accuracy of two VV10 variants, differing in their treatment of the exchange component. For the sake of comparison, several other density functionals suitable for noncovalent interactions were also tested against the same benchmarks. We find that the ?default?? version of VV10 with semilocal exchange gives very accurate geometries and binding energies for most van der Waals complexes but systematically overbinds hydrogen-bonded complexes. The alternative variant of VV10 with long-range corrected hybrid exchange performs exceptionally well for all types of weak bonding sampled in this study, including hydrogen bonds.},

This permits an independent calculation of the slope of the curves of energy vs. position of the nuclei, and may thus increase the accuracy, or decrease the labor involved in the calculation of these curves. The force on a nucleus in an atomic system is shown to be just the classical electrostatic force that would be exerted on this nucleus by other nuclei and by the electrons' charge distribution. Qualitative implications of this are discussed.},

The theory permits calculation of the ground-state density and energy of a many-electron system (e.g., an atom, molecule, or solid) by the selfconsistent solution of a one-electron Schroedinger equation. The theory is exact in principle for these quantities, and in practice the required approximations can be usefully accurate. Here, with few equations and without any claim of optimal selection, we present 12 problems in density functional theory that remain to be solved, with an emphasis on formal problems and on the construction of approximate density functionals. The solutions to some of these problems could go a long way toward deepening understanding of the exact theory and toward improving the accuracy of electronic structure calculations.},

These methods are sometimes corrected to account for dispersion by adding a pairwise C 6 $\slash$ R 6 term, with C 6 dispersion coefficients dependent on the atoms involved. We present a post-Hartree\textendash{}Fock model in which C 6 coefficients are generated by the instantaneous dipole moment of the exchange hole. This model relies on occupied orbitals only, and involves only one, universal, empirical parameter to limit the dispersion energy at small interatomic separations. The model is extensively tested on isotropic C 6 coefficients of 178 intermolecular pairs. It is also applied to the calculation of the geometries and binding energies of 20 intermolecular complexes involving dispersion, dipole-induced dipole, dipole\textendash{}dipole, and hydrogen-bonding interactions, with remarkably good results.},

Our theory predicts dynamic multipole polarizabilities in excellent agreement with more expensive many-body methods, and yields therefrom vdW coefficients C6, C8, C10 for atom pairs with a mean absolute relative error of only 3\%.},

  abstract = {The development and application of computational methods for studying molecular crystals, particularly density-functional theory (DFT), is a large and ever-growing field, driven by their numerous applications. Here we expand on our recent study of the importance of many-body van der Waals interactions in molecular crystals [A. M. Reilly and A. Tkatchenko, J. Phys. Chem. Lett.4, 1028 (Year: 2013)10.1021/jz400226x], with a larger database of 23 molecular crystals. Particular attention has been paid to the role of the vibrational contributions that are required to compare experiment sublimation enthalpies with calculated lattice energies, employing both phonon calculations and experimental heat-capacity data to provide harmonic and anharmonic estimates of the vibrational contributions. Exact exchange, which is rarely considered in DFT studies of molecular crystals, is shown to have a significant contribution to lattice energies, systematically improving agreement between theory and experiment. When the vibrational and exact-exchange contributions are coupled with a many-body approach to dispersion, DFT yields a mean absolute error (3.92 kJ/mol) within the coveted ``chemical accuracy'' target (4.2 kJ/mol). The role of many-body dispersion for structures has also been investigated for a subset of the database, showing good performance compared to X-ray and neutron diffraction crystal structures. The results show that the approach employed here can reach the demanding accuracy of crystal-structure prediction and organic material design with minimal empiricism.},

  abstract = {The emergent properties that arise from self-assembly and molecular recognition phenomena are a direct consequence of non-covalent interactions. Gas-phase measurements and computational methods point to the dominance of dispersion forces in molecular association, but solvent effects complicate the unambiguous quantification of these forces in solution. Here, we have used synthetic molecular balances to measure interactions between apolar alkyl chains in 31 organic, fluorous and aqueous solvent environments. The experimental interaction energies are an order of magnitude smaller than estimates of dispersion forces between alkyl chains that have been derived from vaporization enthalpies and dispersion-corrected calculations. Instead, it was found that cohesive solvent\textendash{}solvent interactions are the major driving force behind apolar association in solution. The results suggest that theoretical models that implicate important roles for dispersion forces in molecular recognition events should be interpreted with caution in solvent-accessible systems.

The method is an extension of the random phase approximation (RPA) derived from time-dependent density functional theory and the adiabatic connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem and contains no fitted parameters. The new kernel is shown to preserve the accurate description of dispersive interactions from RPA while significantly improving the description of short-range correlation in molecules, insulators, and metals. For molecular atomization energies, the rALDA is a factor of 7 better than RPA and a factor of 4 better than the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional when compared to experiments, and a factor of 3 (1.5) better than RPA (PBE) for cohesive energies of solids. For transition metals, the inclusion of full shell semicore states is found to be crucial for both RPA and rALDA calculations and can improve the cohesive energies by up to 0.4 eV. Finally, we discuss straightforward generalizations of the method, which might improve results even further.},

The performance of the different methods is demonstrated for simple systems, such as rare-gas dimers and small organic molecules. The nature of binding at organic/inorganic interfaces is then exemplified for the perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic-3,4,9,10-dianhydride (PTCDA) molecule at surfaces of coinage metals. This fundamental system is the best-characterized organic molecule/metal interface in experiment and theory. We emphasize the crucial importance of a balanced description of both geometry and electronic structure in order to understand and model the properties of such systems.

Our main result is the RPA potential energy surfaces of graphene on the Cu(111), Ni(111), Co(0001), Pd(111), Pt(111), Ag(111), Au(111), and Al(111) metal surfaces, which represent archetypical examples of metal-organic interfaces. Comparison with semilocal density approximations and a nonlocal van der Waals functional show that only the RPA captures both the weak covalent and dispersive forces, which are equally important for these systems. We benchmark our implementation in the gpaw electronic structure code by calculating cohesive energies of graphite and a range of covalently bonded solids and molecules as well as the dissociation curves of H2 and H2+. These results show that the RPA with orbitals from the local density approximation suffers from delocalization errors and systematically underestimates covalent bond energies yielding similar or lower accuracy than the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional for molecules and solids, respectively.},

In this study, we have aimed at assessing the accuracy of dispersion-corrected calculations (DFT-D2, DFT-D3, and DFT-NL) in reproducing the experimental cohesive energy of the anthracene crystal. Preliminary comparison of the interaction energies calculated at revPBE(0)-D3 and revPBE(0)-NL levels in isolated dimers (taken from the crystalline structure) with benchmark calculations performed at the SCS-MP2 and LPNO-pCCSD1a level enlightens the reliability of these DFT-based methods for which the best accuracy achieved is within 1\textendash{}2 kJ/mol of the ab initio methods. Interestingly, the evaluation of the cohesive energy reveals that 35\%\textendash{}37\% of this energy come from the consideration of a second coordination shell. Three-body interaction energy correction is calculated for revPBE-D3 functional and happens to reduce the cohesive energy of an anthracenenanoaggregate by 7 kJ/mol, while similar results are obtained with revPBE(0)-NL functional. In the end, dispersion-corrected estimates of the cohesive energy show sufficiently good agreement with experiment.},

Raw data come from training a vast number of candidate functional forms on a comprehensive training set of 1095 data points and testing the resulting fits on a comprehensive primary test set of 1153 data points. Functional forms are ranked based on their ability to reproduce the data in both the training and primary test sets with minimum empiricism, and filtered based on a set of physical constraints and an often-overlooked condition of satisfactory numerical precision with medium-sized integration grids. The resulting optimal functional form has 4 linear exchange parameters, 4 linear same-spin correlation parameters, and 4 linear opposite-spin correlation parameters, for a total of 12 fitted parameters. The final density functional, B97M-V, is further assessed on a secondary test set of 212 data points, applied to several large systems including the coronene dimer and water clusters, tested for the accurate prediction of intramolecular and intermolecular geometries, verified to have a readily attainable basis set limit, and checked for grid sensitivity. Compared to existing density functionals, B97M-V is remarkably accurate for non-bonded interactions and very satisfactory for thermochemical quantities such as atomization energies, but inherits the demonstrable limitations of existing local density functionals for barrier heights.},

  abstract = {Two complementary strategies can be used in the fabrication of molecular biomaterials. In the 'top-down' approach, biomaterials are generated by stripping down a complex entity into its component parts (for example, paring a virus particle down to its capsid to form a viral cage). This contrasts with the 'bottom-up' approach, in which materials are assembled molecule by molecule (and in some cases even atom by atom) to produce novel supramolecular architectures. The latter approach is likely to become an integral part of nanomaterials manufacture and requires a deep understanding of individual molecular building blocks and their structures, assembly properties and dynamic behaviors. Two key elements in molecular fabrication are chemical complementarity and structural compatibility, both of which confer the weak and noncovalent interactions that bind building blocks together during self-assembly. Using natural processes as a guide, substantial advances have been achieved at the interface of nanomaterials and biology, including the fabrication of nanofiber materials for three-dimensional cell culture and tissue engineering, the assembly of peptide or protein nanotubes and helical ribbons, the creation of living microlenses, the synthesis of metal nanowires on DNA templates, the fabrication of peptide, protein and lipid scaffolds, the assembly of electronic materials by bacterial phage selection, and the use of radiofrequency to regulate molecular behaviors.},

Specifically, we study the behaviour of van der Waals interactions in single-layer and multilayer graphene, fullerenes of varying size, single-wall carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoribbons. As a function of nanostructure size, the van der Waals coefficients follow unusual trends for all of the considered systems, and deviate significantly from the conventionally employed pairwise-additive picture. We propose that the peculiar van der Waals interactions in nanostructured materials could be exploited to control their self-assembly.},

  abstract = {We have investigated various types of $\uppi$-interactions, where one of the interacting $\uppi$-systems is represented by an aromatic benzene molecule. The system includes Rg-$\uppi$, CH-$\uppi$, $\uppi$-$\uppi$(D), $\uppi$-$\uppi$(T), H-$\uppi$(T), $\uppi$+-$\uppi$(D), $\uppi$+-$\uppi$(T), H+-$\uppi$(T), $\uppi$+2-$\uppi$(D), M+-$\uppi$, and M+2-$\uppi$ complexes, where Rg denotes a rare gas or noble atom, M denotes a metal, and D/T indicates displaced-stacked/T-shaped structure. The microsolvation effect is also considered. We note that the interaction between a cationic $\uppi$ system and a neutral $\uppi$ system ($\uppi$cation-$\uppi$ interaction) is so far ambiguously considered as either $\uppi$-$\uppi$ or cation-$\uppi$ interaction. In terms of total binding energy, the $\uppi$cation-$\uppi$ interaction is weaker than the cation?$\uppi$ interaction, but much stronger than the $\uppi$-$\uppi$ interaction. When the hydrophilic (N?H)+ or (C?H)+ group in a singly charged $\uppi$+ system (as in protonated histidine, arginine, pyridine, or dimethyl imidazolium) interacts with a $\uppi$-system, the complex favors a T-shaped form [$\uppi$+-$\uppi$(T) complex]. However, in the presence of polar solvating molecules or counteranions, these species interact with the (N?H)+/(C?H)+ group, while the $\uppi$+ system interacts with the neutral aromatic ring. Then, the displaced-stacked form [$\uppi$+-$\uppi$(D) complex] is favored or otherwise nearly isoenergetic to the $\uppi$+-$\uppi$(T) form. The $\uppi$+-$\uppi$ systems are stabilized mainly by both dispersion and electrostatic energies. Ternary diagrams using either attractive energy components or both attractive and repulsive energy components show that the $\uppi$+-$\uppi$(D) complexes have more contribution from dispersion energy but less contribution from induction energy than the $\uppi$+-$\uppi$(T) complexes, while both complexes have similar percentage contributions from electrostatic and exchange energy components. In particular, the $\uppi$+-$\uppi$(D) complexes are found to be distinctly different from the $\uppi$-$\uppi$ complexes and the non-$\uppi$ organic or metallic cation-$\uppi$ complexes.},

MP2, MP4, and CCSD(T) calculations with various basis sets up to the augmented correlation consistent polarized double-zeta (aug-cc-pvdz) one were performed for the sandwich (S), T-shaped (T), and parallel-displaced (PD) structures of the benzene dimer. MP2 strongly overestimates the stabilization energy and leads to incorrect global minimum. Also, the MP4 predictions differ from the CCSD(T) ones. At the CCSD(T) level the T structure was the most stable structure with stabilization energy of about 2.3 kcal/mol. The PD structure at the same level was found to be slightly less stable (by 0.2?0.3 kcal/mol). The energy difference between these structures is sensitive to the theoretical level applied, and we estimated that both structures are similarly stable. The absolute value of stabilization energy is believed to be close to the genuine value; this conclusion was based on study of basis set saturation where basis sets up to [4s3p2d1f] were utilized. Performance of existing empirical potentials is evaluated. The existence of the C?H$\cdot\cdot\cdot\pi$ H-bond was not confirmed. Finally, consequences of the existence of two similarly stable structures of the benzene dimer for the structure and function of proteins are discussed.},

On the basis of previous works performed on multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), the goal is to fill the inner SWNT cavity with various compounds, whose the combination with the surrounding carbon tube is expected to allow peculiar physical phenomena to occur and/or peculiar properties to be obtained. As compared to MWNTs, regular SWNT inner cavity is really nanometric, i.e., in the dimension range where quantum phenomena could occur. However, a major drawback is that filling $\sim$1-nm wide tubes is less easy (i.e., compared to MWNTs), and the related driving forces not fully understood. Who is working in the field, what and how are the SWNT-based hybrid nano-materials prepared so far, what could possibly be the filling mechanisms, are questions that are discussed in this paper.

These reference data are then used to evaluate the performance of several density-functional theory exchange-correlation (xc) functionals. A subset of the xc functionals tested for smaller water clusters [I. Santra et al., J. Chem. Phys.127, 184104 (2007)] has been considered. While certain functionals do a reasonable job at predicting the absolute dissociation energies of the various isomers (coming within 10 \textendash{} 20 meV / H 2 O ), none predict the correct energetic ordering of the four isomers nor does any predict the correct low total energy isomer. All xc functionals tested either predict the book or cyclic isomers to have the largest dissociation energies. A many-body decomposition of the total interactionenergies within the hexamers leads to the conclusion that the failure lies in the poor description of van der Waals (dispersion) forces in the xc functionals considered. It is shown that the addition of an empirical pairwise (attractive) C 6 R - 6 correction to certain functionals allows for an improved energetic ordering of the hexamers.

Rev. Lett. 93, 153004 (2004); J. Chem. Phys. 122, 014113 (2005)]. In this study, we investigate a small library of dispersion-corrected atom-centered potentials (DCACP's) for C, Ar, Kr, and Br. To this end, we calibrate DCACP's in order to reproduce the equilibrium distance and binding energy of MP2 potential energy surfaces of the weakly bonded homodimers Ar2, Kr2, and (Br2)2. In all cases studied, using DFT with the generalized gradient approximation functional BLYP and the DCACP's, the influence of dispersion forces on equilibrium and transition-state geometries, interaction energies, and transition barriers can be reproduced in good agreement with MP2 calculations and without any significant increase in computational cost. The transferability of the DCACP's to other systems is assessed by addressing various weakly bonded complexes. We investigate (i) ideal van der Waals clusters of the type ArnKrm ($\forall$n,m=\{0,1,2,3,4\} and 2$\leqslant$n+m$\leqslant$4), (ii) the effect of DCACP's on covalent bonds and conformers of the hydrocarbon molecule cyclooctatetraene which features a system of $\uppi$ bonds, and (iii) the competition of simultaneous electrostatic and dispersion forces for the equilibrium structure and transition states of the hydrogen bromide dimer (HBr)2. In all cases, the performance of the DCACP's to these extended set of systems is remarkably good.},

  volume = {46},
  doi = {10.1021/ar3000844},
  abstract = {Aromatic interactions play a key role in many chemical and biological systems. However, even if very simple models are chosen, the systems of interest are often too large to be handled with standard wave function theory (WFT). Although density functional theory (DFT) can easily treat systems of more than 200 atoms, standard semilocal (hybrid) density functional approximations fail to describe the London dispersion energy, a factor that is essential for accurate predictions of inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions. Therefore dispersion-corrected DFT provides a unique tool for the investigation and analysis of a wide range of complex aromatic systems.In this Account, we start with an analysis of the noncovalent interactions in simple model dimers of hexafluorobenzene (HFB) and benzene, with a focus on electrostatic and dispersion interactions. The minima for the parallel-displaced dimers of HFB/HFB and HFB/benzene can only be explained when taking into account all contributions to the interaction energy and not by electrostatics alone. By comparison of saturated and aromatic model complexes, we show that increased dispersion coefficients for sp2-hybridized carbon atoms play a major role in aromatic stacking.Modern dispersion-corrected DFT yields accurate results (about 5?10\% error for the dimerization energy) for the relatively large porphyrin and coronene dimers, systems for which WFT can provide accurate reference data only with huge computational effort. In this example, it is also demonstrated that new nonlocal, density-dependent dispersion corrections and atom pairwise schemes mutually agree with each other.The dispersion energy is also important for the complex inter- and intramolecular interactions that arise in the molecular crystals of aromatic molecules. In studies of hexahelicene, dispersion-corrected DFT yields ?the right answer for the right reason?. By comparison, standard DFT calculations reproduce intramolecular distances quite accurately in single-molecule calculations while inter- and intramolecular distances become too large when dispersion-uncorrected solid-state calculations are carried out. Dispersion-corrected DFT can fix this problem, and these results are in excellent agreement with experimental structure and energetic (sublimation) data. Uncorrected treatments do not even yield a bound crystal state.Finally, we present calculations for the formation of a cationic, quadruply charged dimer of a porphyrin derivative, a case where dispersion is required in order to overcome strong electrostatic repulsion. A combination of dispersion-corrected DFT with an adequate continuum solvation model can accurately reproduce experimental free association enthalpies in solution. As in the previous examples, consideration of the electrostatic interactions alone does not provide a qualitatively or quantitatively correct picture of the interactions of this complex.},

The agreement between our results and high level ab initio or experimental data illustrates the transferability of the DCACP scheme for the gas and condensed phase as well as for different hybridization states of carbon. The typical error of binding energies for gas-phase dimers amounts to 0.3 kcal/mol. This work demonstrates that only one DCACP per element is sufficient to correct for weak interactions in a large variety of systems, irrespective of the hybridization state.},

[10]CPP and [11]CPP exothermically formed 1:1 complexes with C70, thereby giving the resulting peapods. A van${'}$t Hoff plot analysis revealed that the formation of these complexes in 1,2-dichlorobenzene was mainly driven by entropy, whereas the theoretical calculations suggested that the formation of the complex in the gas phase was predominantly driven by enthalpy. C70 was found to exist in two distinct orientations inside the CPP cavity, namely ``lying'' and ``standing'', depending on the specific size of the CPP. The theoretical calculations and the X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed that the interactions between [10]CPP and the short axis of C70 in its lying orientation were isotropic and similar to those observed between [10]CPP and C60. However, the interactions between [11]CPP and C70 in its standing orientation were anisotropic, thereby involving the radial deformation of [11]CPP into an ellipsoidal shape. This ``induced fit'' maximized the van der Waals interactions with the long axis of C70. Theoretical calculations revealed that the deformation occurred readily with low energy loss, thus suggesting that CPPs are highly radially elastic molecules. These results also indicate that the same type of radial deformation should occur in CNT peapods that encapsulate anisotropic fullerenes.},

  abstract = {The method proposed by Tkatchenko and Scheffler [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 073005 (2009)] to correct density functional calculations for the missing van der Waals interactions is implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (vasp) code and tested on a wide range of solids, including noble-gas crystals, molecular crystals ($\alpha$-N2, sulfur dioxide, benzene, naphthalene, cytosine), layered solids (graphite, hexagonal boron nitride, vanadium pentoxide, MoS2, NbSe2), chain-like structures (selenium, tellurium, cellulose I), ionic crystals (NaCl, KI), and metals (nickel, zinc, cadmium). In addition to the original formulation expressing the van der Waals (vdW) corrections as pairwise potentials whose strength is derived from the rescaled polarizabilities of the neutral free atoms, the self-consistently screened (TS+SCS) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 236402 (2012)] variant of the method involving electrodynamic response effects has been examined. Analytical expressions for the forces acting on the atoms and for the components of the stress tensor needed for the relaxation of the volume and shape of the unit cell using the TS+SCS method are derived. While the calculated structures are reasonably close to experiment, the van der Waals corrections to the binding energies are often found to be overestimated in comparison with experimental data. The TS+SCS approach leads to significantly better results in some problematic cases, such as the binding energy of graphite. However, there is room for further improvements, in particular for strongly ionic systems.},

  abstract = {Nearly all common density functional approximations fail to properly describe dispersion interactions responsible for binding in van der Waals complexes. Empirical corrections can fix some of the failures but cannot fully grasp the complex physics and may not be reliable for systems dissimilar to the fitting set. In contrast, the recently proposed nonlocal van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) was derived from first principles, describes dispersion interactions in a seamless fashion, and yields the correct asymptotics. Implementation of this functional is somewhat cumbersome: Nonlocal dependence on the electron density requires numerical double integration over the space variables and functional derivatives are nontrivial. This paper shows how vdW-DF can be implemented self-consistently with Gaussian basis functions. The gradients of the energy with respect to nuclear displacements have also been derived and coded, enabling efficient geometry optimizations. We test the vdW-DF correlation functional in combination with several exchange approximations. We also study the sensitivity of the method to the basis set size and to the quality of the numerical quadrature grid. For weakly interacting systems, acceptable accuracy in semilocal exchange is achieved only with fine grids, whereas for nonlocal vdW-DF correlation even rather coarse grids are sufficient. The current version of vdW-DF is not well suited for pairing with Hartree-Fock exchange, leading to considerable overbinding.},

In this work, we establish the concept of rPT2 and present the numerical details of our SOSEX and rSE implementations. A preliminary version of rPT2, in which the renormalized SE (rSE) contribution was treated approximately, has already been benchmarked for molecular atomization energies and chemical reaction barrier heights and shows a well-balanced performance [J. Paier et al., New J. Phys. 14, 043002 (2012)]. In this work, we present a refined version of rPT2, in which we evaluate the rSE series of diagrams rigorously. We then extend the benchmark studies to noncovalent interactions, including the rare-gas dimers, and the S22 and S66 test sets, as well as the cohesive energy of small copper clusters, and the equilibrium geometry of 10 diatomic molecules. Despite some remaining shortcomings, we conclude that rPT2 gives an overall satisfactory performance across different electronic situations, and is a promising step towards a generally applicable electronic-structure approach.},

  abstract = {A detailed analysis that benefits from a slate of new approximate numerical and exact asymptotic results produces highly accurate properties of the ground state of the harmonium atom as functions of the confinement strength $\omega$ and quantifies the domains of the weakly and strongly correlated regimes in this system. The former regime, which encompasses the values of $\omega$ greater than $\omega$ crit $\approx$4.011 624\texttimes{}10 -2 , is characterized by the one-electron density $\rho$($\omega$;r 1 ) with a global maximum at r 1 =0. In contrast, the harmonium atom within the latter regime, which corresponds to $\omega$\&lt;$\omega$ crit , differs fundamentally from both its weakly correlated counterpart and Coulombic systems. Resembling a Wigner crystal of a homogeneous electron gas, it possesses a radially localized pair of angularly correlated electrons that gives rise to $\rho$($\omega$;r 1 ) with a ``fat attractor'' composed of a cage critical point and a (1, -1) critical sphere. Allowing for a continuous variation in $\omega$, the new compact representation of the ground-statewave function and accurate approximants for the corresponding electronic properties are designed to facilitate the use of harmonium in research on electron correlation and density functionals.},

  abstract = {The DFT/vdW-WF method, recently developed to include the Van der Waals interactions in Density Functional Theory (DFT) using the maximally localized Wannier functions, is applied to the study of the adsorption of rare-gas atoms (Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe) on the Cu(111) and Pb(111) surfaces at three high-symmetry sites. We evaluate the equilibrium binding energies and distances and the induced work-function changes and dipole moments. We find that for Ne, Ar, and Kr on the Cu(111) surface the different adsorption configurations are characterized by very similar binding energies while the favored adsorption site for Xe on Cu(111) is on top of a Cu atom, in agreement with previous theoretical calculations and experimental findings and in common with other close-packed metal surfaces. Instead, the favored site is always the hollow one on the Pb(111) surface, which therefore represents an interesting system where the investigation of high-coordination sites is possible. Moreover, the Pb(111) substrate is subject, upon rare-gas adsorption, to a significantly smaller change in the work function (and to a correspondingly smaller induced dipole moment) than Cu(111). The roles of the chosen reference DFT functional and of different van der Waals corrections as well as their dependence on different rare-gas adatoms are also discussed.},

Here, we show that the fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) method with a more favorable scaling is capable of reaching the CCSD(T)/CBS within subchemical accuracy ($<$0.1 kcal/mol) on a testing set of six small noncovalent complexes including the water dimer. In benzene/water, benzene/methane, and the T-shape benzene dimer, FN-DMC provides interaction energies that agree within 0.25 kcal/mol with the best available CCSD(T)/CBS estimates. The demonstrated predictive power of FN-DMC therefore provides new opportunities for studies of the vast and important class of medium/large noncovalent complexes.},

  abstract = {The electronic ground state of a periodic system is usually described in terms of extended Bloch orbitals, but an alternative representation in terms of localized ``Wannier functions'' was introduced by Gregory Wannier in 1937. The connection between the Bloch and Wannier representations is realized by families of transformations in a continuous space of unitary matrices, carrying a large degree of arbitrariness. Since 1997, methods have been developed that allow one to iteratively transform the extended Bloch orbitals of a first-principles calculation into a unique set of maximally localized Wannier functions, accomplishing the solid-state equivalent of constructing localized molecular orbitals, or ``Boys orbitals'' as previously known from the chemistry literature. These developments are reviewed here, and a survey of the applications of these methods is presented. This latter includes a description of their use in analyzing the nature of chemical bonding, or as a local probe of phenomena related to electric polarization and orbital magnetization. Wannier interpolation schemes are also reviewed, by which quantities computed on a coarse reciprocal-space mesh can be used to interpolate onto much finer meshes at low cost, and applications in which Wannier functions are used as efficient basis functions are discussed. Finally the construction and use of Wannier functions outside the context of electronic-structure theory is presented, for cases that include phonon excitations, photonic crystals, and cold-atom optical lattices.},

In the limit of long wavelengths and low frequencies, it is shown that the dielectric constant can be split into an acceleration term that describes the motion of electrons from atom to atom and an atomic term that describes the motion of the electrons around each atom. It is proved that the acceleration term contains no local field correction whereas the atomic term does contain a local field correction. The local field correction is calculated explicitly for the weak binding limit and is found to be of the same order in the weak potential as the atomic term, but the coefficient is much smaller for most Fermi surfaces. This justifies, for most Fermi surfaces, the common practice of neglecting local field corrections. In the tight-binding limit, the Lorentz expression for the dielectric constant is obtained.},

  abstract = {Supramolecular host?guest systems play an important role for a wide range of applications in chemistry and biology. The prediction of the stability of host?guest complexes represents a great challenge to first-principles calculations due to an interplay of a wide variety of covalent and noncovalent interactions in these systems. In particular, van der Waals (vdW) dispersion interactions frequently play a prominent role in determining the structure, stability, and function of supramolecular systems. On the basis of the widely used benchmark case of the buckyball catcher complex (C60@C60H28), we assess the feasibility of computing the binding energy of supramolecular host?guest complexes from first principles. Large-scale diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations are carried out to accurately determine the binding energy for the C60@C60H28 complex (26 $\pm$ 2 kcal/mol). On the basis of the DMC reference, we assess the accuracy of widely used and efficient density-functional theory (DFT) methods with dispersion interactions. The inclusion of vdW dispersion interactions in DFT leads to a large stabilization of the C60@C60H28 complex. However, DFT methods including pairwise vdW interactions overestimate the stability of this complex by 9?17 kcal/mol compared to the DMC reference and the extrapolated experimental data. A significant part of this overestimation (9 kcal/mol) stems from the lack of dynamical dielectric screening effects in the description of the molecular polarizability in pairwise dispersion energy approaches. The remaining overstabilization arises from the isotropic treatment of atomic polarizability tensors and the lack of many-body dispersion interactions. A further assessment of a different supramolecular system ? glycine anhydride interacting with an amide macrocycle ? demonstrates that both the dynamical screening and the many-body dispersion energy are complex contributions that are very sensitive to the underlying molecular geometry and type of bonding. We discuss the required improvements in theoretical methods for achieving ?chemical accuracy? in the first-principles modeling of supramolecular systems.},

  abstract = {Computation of lattice energies to an accuracy sufficient to distinguish polymorphs is a fundamental bottleneck in crystal structure prediction. For the lattice energy of the prototypical benzene crystal, we combined the quantum chemical advances of the last decade to attain sub-kilojoule per mole accuracy, an order-of-magnitude improvement in certainty over prior calculations that necessitates revision of the experimental extrapolation to 0 kelvin. Our computations reveal the nature of binding by improving on previously inaccessible or inaccurate multibody and many-electron contributions and provide revised estimates of the effects of temperature, vibrations, and relaxation. Our demonstration raises prospects for definitive first-principles resolution of competing polymorphs in molecular crystal structure prediction.
Working out how to pack benzene in silico
Many organic compounds crystallize in several different energetically similar packing arrangements, or polymorphs. This complicates processes such as drug formulation that rely on reproducible crystallization. Yang et al. have now achieved the long-standing goal of calculating a crystal packing arrangement from first principles to an accuracy that can distinguish polymorphs (see the Perspective by Price). They used benzene as a prototypical test case and applied quantum chemical methods that improve estimates of multibody interactions. The results bode well for future applications of theory to optimization of crystallization protocols.

The RPA is found to recover most of the strong static correlation at large bond distance. Atomization energies of main-group molecules are rather uniformly underestimated by the RPA. The method performs better than generalized-gradient-type approximations (GGA's) only for some electron-rich systems. However, the RPA functional is free of error cancellation between exchange and correlation, and behaves qualitatively correct in the high-density limit, as is demonstrated by the coupling strength decomposition of the atomization energy of F2.

We demonstrate that such methods enable well-behaved exchange-correlation approximations in very flexible model spaces, thus avoiding the overfitting found when standard least-squares methods are applied to high-order polynomial expansions. A general-purpose density functional for surface science and catalysis studies should accurately describe bond breaking and formation in chemistry, solid state physics, and surface chemistry, and should preferably also include van der Waals dispersion interactions. Such a functional necessarily compromises between describing fundamentally different types of interactions, making transferability of the density functional approximation a key issue. We investigate this trade-off between describing the energetics of intramolecular and intermolecular, bulk solid, and surface chemical bonding, and the developed optimization method explicitly handles making the compromise based on the directions in model space favored by different materials properties. The approach is applied to designing the Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals correlation (BEEF\textendash{}vdW), a semilocal approximation with an additional nonlocal correlation term. Furthermore, an ensemble of functionals around BEEF\textendash{}vdW comes out naturally, offering an estimate of the computational error. An extensive assessment on a range of data sets validates the applicability of BEEF\textendash{}vdW to studies in chemistry and condensed matter physics. Applications of the approximation and its Bayesian ensemble error estimate to two intricate surface science problems support this.},

  abstract = {The method of dispersion correction as an add-on to standard Kohn\textendash{}Sham density functional theory (DFT-D) has been refined regarding higher accuracy, broader range of applicability, and less empiricism. The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15\%\textendash{}40\% compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C 6 coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10\%) weakens the interlayer binding. We propose the revised DFT-D method as a general tool for the computation of the dispersion energy in molecules and solids of any kind with DFT and related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems.},

  abstract = {Recently we have demonstrated that the applicability of the Tkatchenko-Scheffler (TS) method for calculating dispersion corrections to density-functional theory can be extended to ionic systems if the Hirshfeld method for estimating effective volumes and charges of atoms in molecules or solids (AIM's) is replaced by its iterative variant [T. Bu{\v c}ko, S. Leb{\`e}gue, J. Hafner, and J. {\'A}ngy{\'a}n, J. Chem. Theory Comput.9, 4293 (2013)]. The standard Hirshfeld method uses neutral atoms as a reference, whereas in the iterative Hirshfeld (HI) scheme the fractionally charged atomic reference states are determined self-consistently. We show that the HI method predicts more realistic AIM charges and that the TS/HI approach leads to polarizabilities and C 6 dispersion coefficients in ionic or partially ionic systems which are, as expected, larger for anions than for cations (in contrast to the conventional TS method). For crystalline materials, the new algorithm predicts polarizabilities per unit cell in better agreement with the values derived from the Clausius-Mosotti equation. The applicability of the TS/HI method has been tested for a wide variety of molecular and solid-state systems. It is demonstrated that for systems dominated by covalent interactions and/or dispersion forces the TS/HI method leads to the same results as the conventional TS approach. The difference between the TS/HI and TS approaches increases with increasing ionicity. A detailed comparison is presented for isoelectronic series of octet compounds, layered crystals, complex intermetallic compounds, and hydrides, and for crystals built of molecules or containing molecular anions. It is demonstrated that only the TS/HI method leads to accurate results for systems where both electrostatic and dispersion interactions are important, as illustrated for Li-intercalated graphite and for molecular adsorption on the surfaces in ionic solids and in the cavities of zeolites.},

All crystal-structure prediction methods acknowledge the crucial contribution of van der Waals or dispersion interactions, but few go beyond a pairwise additive description of dispersion, ignoring its many-body nature. Here we use two databases to show how a many-body approach to dispersion can seamlessly model both solid and gas-phase interactions within the coveted ?chemical accuracy? benchmark, while the underlying pairwise approach fails for solid-state interactions due to the absence of many-body polarization and energy contributions. Our results show that recently developed methods that treat the truly collective nature of dispersion interactions are able to reach the accuracy required for predicting molecular materials, when coupled with nonempirical density functionals.},

Coupled-cluster theory through perturbative triple excitations in conjunction with large basis sets and extrapolations to the complete basis set limit have provided definitive results for the binding energy of several configurations of the benzene dimer, and benchmark-quality ab initio potential curves are being used to calibrate new density functional and force-field models for $\uppi$?$\uppi$ interactions.

These include dispersion-corrected DFT (using explicit, attractive dispersion terms), parameterized functionals, and dispersion-correcting potentials, all of which can dramatically improve performance for dispersion-bound species. In this perspective, we highlight the achievements made in modeling dispersion using DFT.

The analysis of this functional with respect to the range of the associated interaction reveals that, in the limit of a very short-range interaction, the short-range exchange-correlation energy can be expressed as a simple local functional of the on-top pair density and its first derivatives. This provides an explanation for the accuracy of the local density approximation (LDA) for the short-range functional. Moreover, this analysis leads also to new simple approximations for the short-range exchange and correlation energies improving the LDA.},

The best performing method is MP2.5 with relative root-mean-square deviation (rRMSD) of 4\%. It can thus be recommended as an alternative to the CCSD(T)/CBS (alternatively QCISD(T)/CBS) benchmark for molecular systems which exceed current computational capacity. The second best non-DFT method is MP2C with rRMSD of 8\%. A method with the most favorable ?accuracy/cost? ratio belongs to the DFT family: BLYP-D3, with an rRMSD of 8\%. Semiempirical methods deliver less accurate results (the rRMSD exceeds 25\%). Nevertheless, their absolute errors are close to some much more expensive methods, such as M06-2X, MP2, or SCS(MI)-MP2, and thus their price/performance ratio is excellent.},

  abstract = {This work reviews the increasing evidence that many-body van der Waals (vdW) or dispersion interactions play a crucial role in the structure, stability and function of a wide variety of systems in biology, chemistry and physics. Starting with the exact expression for the electron correlation energy provided by the adiabatic connection fluctuation\textendash{}dissipation theorem, we derive both pairwise and many-body interatomic methods for computing the long-range dispersion energy by considering a model system of coupled quantum harmonic oscillators within the random-phase approximation. By coupling this approach to density functional theory, the resulting many-body dispersion (MBD) method provides an accurate and efficient scheme for computing the frequency-dependent polarizability and many-body vdW energy in molecules and materials with a finite electronic gap. A select collection of applications are presented that ascertain the fundamental importance of these non-bonded interactions across the spectrum of intermolecular (the S22 and S66 benchmark databases), intramolecular (conformational energies of alanine tetrapeptide) and supramolecular (binding energy of the `buckyball catcher') complexes, as well as molecular crystals (cohesive energies in oligoacenes). These applications demonstrate that electrodynamic response screening and beyond-pairwise many-body vdW interactions\textemdash{}both captured at the MBD level of theory\textemdash{}play a quantitative, and sometimes even qualitative, role in describing the properties considered herein. This work is then concluded with an in-depth discussion of the challenges that remain in the future development of reliable (accurate and efficient) methods for treating many-body vdW interactions in complex materials and provides a roadmap for navigating many of the research avenues that are yet to be explored.},

This allows conclusions about the performance of each method in an explorative research setting on ?real-life? problems. Most DFT methods show satisfactory performance but, due to the largeness of the complexes, almost always require an explicit correction for the nonadditive Axilrod?Teller?Muto three-body dispersion interaction to get accurate results. The necessity of using a method capable of accounting for dispersion is clearly demonstrated in that the two-body dispersion contributions are on the order of 20?150\% of the total interaction energy. MP2 and some variants thereof are shown to be insufficient for this while a few tested D3-corrected semiempirical MO methods perform reasonably well.

  abstract = {van der Waals interactions between atoms and molecules are ubiquitous and very important for many molecular and condensed-matter structures. These systems are often studied from first principles using the density functional theory (DFT), because this approach often represents a good compromise between accuracy and efficiency. However, the commonly used DFT functionals are not able to describe properly van der Waals effects. Most attempts to correct for this problem have a basic semiempirical character, although computationally more expensive first principles schemes have been recently developed. Of course, the key issue is finding a way to include van der Waals interactions in DFT without dramatically increasing the computational cost. We here describe in detail the recently developed scheme, based on the use of the maximally localized Wannier functions, that combines the simplicity of the semiempirical formalism with the accuracy of the first principles approaches and appears to be promising, being simple, efficient, accurate, and transferable (for instance, charge polarization effects are naturally included). The results of successful applications to small molecules, bulk Ar, and the interaction of Ar, He, and H2 with two different Al surfaces are presented.

  abstract = {We present a model for the calculation of the polarization properties of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. This model describes each atom by both a net electric charge and a dipole. Compared to dipole-only models, the consideration of electric charges enables one to account for the displacement of free electrons in structures subject to an external field. It also enables one to account for the accumulation of additional charges. By expressing the electrostatic interactions in terms of normalized propagators, the model achieves a better consistency as well as an improved stability. In its most elementary form, the model depends on a single adjustable parameter and provides an excellent agreement with other experimental and theoretical data. The technique is applied to a C720 fullerene and to open and closed (5,5) nanotubes. The simulations demonstrate the improved stability of our algorithm. In addition, they quantify the role of free charges in the polarization of these structures. The paper finally investigates the field-enhancement properties of open and closed (5,5) nanotubes.},

Among the functionals tested, the most successful is the nonlocal optPBE-vdW functional of Klime? and Michaelides that predicts unit cell volumes for all crystals of the reference set within the target error range of $\pm$3\% and gives individual lattice parameters with a mean average percent error of less than 0.81\%. The DCACP, Grimme?s D3, and Becke and Johnson?s exchange-hole (XDM) methods, when used with the BLYP, PBE, and B86b functionals, respectively, are also quite successful at predicting the lattice parameters of the test set.},

We use this potential for a self-consistent calculation of the ground state properties of a number of van der Waals complexes as well as crystalline silicon. For the latter, where little or no van der Waals interaction is expected, we find that the results are mostly determined by semilocal exchange and correlation as in standard generalized gradient approximations (GGA), with the fully nonlocal term giving little effect. On the other hand, our results for the van der Waals complexes show that the self-consistency has little effect on the atomic interaction energy and structure at equilibrium distances. This finding validates previous calculations with the same functional that treated the fully nonlocal term as a post-GGA perturbation. A comparison of our results with wave-function calculations demonstrates the usefulness of our approach. The exchange-correlation potential also allows us to calculate Hellmann-Feynman forces, hence providing the means for efficient geometry relaxations as well as unleashing the potential use of other standard techniques that depend on the self-consistent charge distribution. The nature of the van der Waals bond is discussed in terms of the self-consistent bonding charge.},

To address this question, we design an exchange functional based on this plasmon description as well as recent analysis on exchange in the large-s regime. In the regime with reduced gradients s=|$\nabla$n|/2nkF(n) smaller than $\approx$2.5, dominating the nonlocal correlation part of the binding energy, the enhancement factor Fx(s) closely resembles the Langreth-Vosko screened exchange. In the s regime beyond, dominated by exchange, Fx(s) passes smoothly over to the revised Perdew-Wang-86 form. We term the specific exchange functional LV-PW86r, wheras the full van der Waals functional version emphasizing consistent handling of exchange is termed vdW-DF-cx. Our tests indicate that vdW-DF-cx produces accurate separations and binding energies of the S22 data set of molecular dimers as well as accurate lattice constants and bulk moduli of layered materials and tightly bound solids. These results suggest that the plasmon description within vdW-DF gives a good description of both exchange and correlation effects in the low-to-moderate s regime.},

  abstract = {Density functional approximations fail to provide a consistent description of weak molecular interactions arising from small electron density overlaps. A simple remedy to correct for the missing interactions is to add a posteriori an attractive energy term summed over all atom pairs in the system. The density-dependent energy correction, presented herein, is applicable to all elements of the periodic table and is easily combined with any electronic structure method, which lacks the accurate treatment of weak interactions. Dispersion coefficients are computed according to Becke and Johnson?s exchange-hole dipole moment (XDM) formalism, thereby depending on the chemical environment of an atom (density, oxidation state). The long-range ?R?6 potential is supplemented with higher-order correction terms (?R?8 and ?R?10) through the universal damping function of Tang and Toennies. A genuine damping factor depending on (iterative) Hirshfeld (overlap) populations, atomic ionization energies, and two adjustable parameters specifically fitted to a given DFT functional is also introduced. The proposed correction, dDXDM, dramatically improves the performance of popular density functionals. The analysis of 30 (dispersion corrected) density functionals on 145 systems reveals that dDXDM largely reduces the errors of the parent functionals for both inter- and intramolecular interactions. With mean absolute deviations (MADs) of 0.74?0.84 kcal mol?1, PBE-dDXDM, PBE0-dDXDM, and B3LYP-dDXDM outperform the computationally more demanding and most recent functionals such as M06-2X and B2PLYP-D (MAD of 1.93 and 1.06 kcal mol?1, respectively).},

Our understanding of these relatively weak yet ubiquitous quantum mechanical interactions has improved significantly during the past decade. This understanding has been largely driven by the development of efficient methods that now enable the modeling of vdW interactions in many realistic materials of interest for fundamental scientific questions and technological applications. In this work, the physics behind the currently available vdW methods are reviewed, and their applications to a wide variety of materials are highlighted, ranging from molecular assemblies to solids with and without defects, nanostructures of varying size and dimensionality, as well as interfaces between inorganic and organic materials. The origin of collective vdW interactions in materials is discussed using the concept of topological dipole waves. Focus is placed on the important observation that the full many-body treatment of vdW interactions becomes crucial in the investigation and characterization of materials with increasing complexity, especially when studying their response properties, including vibrational, mechanical, and optical phenomena. Despite significant recent advances, many challenges still remain in the development of accurate and efficient methods for treating vdW interactions that will be broadly applicable to the modeling of functional materials at all relevant length and timescales.},

We show that the two-body terms up to R -10, but not the terms of higher-order, are essential in the correct description of the dispersion energy, while there are a number of difficulties related to the choice of the damping function, which precludes the use three-body triple-dipole contributions in XDM.

  abstract = {The adsorption of benzene and C60 on graphene and boron nitride is studied using density functional theory with the van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF). By comparing these systems we can systematically investigate their adsorption nature and differences between the two functional versions vdW-DF1 and vdW-DF2. The bigger size of the C60 molecule makes it bind stronger to the surface than benzene, yet the interfaces between the molecules and the sheets are similar in nature. The binding separation is more sensitive to the exchange variant used in vdW-DF than to the correlation version. This result is related to the exchange and correlation components of the potential energy curve. We show that a moderate dipole forms for C60 on graphene, unlike for the other adsorption systems. We find that the corrugation (at the atomic scale) is very sensitive to the variant or version of vdW-DF used, in particular, the exchange. Further, we show that this sensitivity arises indirectly through the shift in binding separation caused by changing the vdW-DF variant. Based on our results, we suggest a concerted theory-experiment approach to assess the exchange and correlation contributions to physisorption. Using DFT calculations, the corrugation can be linked to the optimal separation, allowing us to extract the exchange-correlation part of the adsorption energy. Molecules with the same interfaces to the surface, but different geometries, can in turn cast light on the role of van der Waals forces.},

The method is based on the local response approximation due to Dobson and Dinte [Phys. Rev. Lett.76, 1780 (1996)], with modified dielectric model recently proposed by Vydrov and van Voorhis [J. Chem. Phys.130, 104105 (2009)]. The local response model is used to calculate the distributed multipole polarizabilities of atoms in a molecule, from which the dispersion coefficients are obtained by an explicit frequency integral of the Casimir\textendash{}Polder type. Thus obtained atomic polarizabilities are also used in the damping function for the short-range singularity. Unlike empirical DFT-D methods, the local response dispersion (LRD) method is able to calculate the dispersion energy from the ground-state electron density only. It is applicable to any geometry, free from physical constants such as van der Waals radii or atomic polarizabilities, and computationally very efficient. The LRD method combined with the long-range corrected DFT functional (LC-BOP) is applied to calculations of S22 weakly bound complex set [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.8, 1985 (2006)].

Ten neutral and three positively charged complexes with experimental $\Delta$Ga values in the range 0 to -21\hspace{0.25em}kcal\,mol-1 (on average -6\hspace{0.25em}kcal\,mol-1) are investigated. The theoretical approach employs a (nondynamic) single-structure model, but computes the various energy terms accurately without any special empirical adjustments. Dispersion corrected density functional theory (DFT-D3) with extended basis sets (triple-$\zeta$ and quadruple-$\zeta$ quality) is used to determine structures and gas-phase interaction energies ($\Delta$E), the COSMO-RS continuum solvation model (based on DFT data) provides solvation free enthalpies and the remaining ro-vibrational enthalpic/entropic contributions are obtained from harmonic frequency calculations. Low-lying vibrational modes are treated by a free-rotor approximation. The accurate account of London dispersion interactions is mandatory with contributions in the range -5 to -60\hspace{0.25em}kcal\,mol-1 (up to 200\,\% of $\Delta$E). Inclusion of three-body dispersion effects improves the results considerably. A semilocal (TPSS) and a hybrid density functional (PW6B95) have been tested. Although the $\Delta$Ga values result as a sum of individually large terms with opposite sign ($\Delta$E vs. solvation and entropy change), the approach provides unprecedented accuracy for $\Delta$Ga values with errors of only 2\hspace{0.25em}kcal\,mol-1 on average. Relative affinities for different guests inside the same host are always obtained correctly. The procedure is suggested as a predictive tool in supramolecular chemistry and can be applied routinely to semirigid systems with 300\textendash{}400 atoms. The various contributions to binding and enthalpy\textendash{}entropy compensations are discussed.},

The Laplace equation and boundary conditions of electrodynamics at the void surfaces are formally solved by using the bispherical coordinate system. The problem is reduced to the eigenvalue problem of an infinite matrix. The solutions for two identical voids and appropriate to a large void separation D compared to the voids radius R are found by perturbation theory. To first order in R3D3, only the dipolar plasma oscillations around the void surfaces have frequencies perturbed by the void-void interaction. As a result, the interaction energy behaves like the inverse sixth power just like it does for full spherical particles in vacuum. This contradicts an earlier conjecture that monopolar dispersion forces should exist between empty cavities. The coefficient of the D-6 power law at large separation is different for the two systems due to multiation interactions.},

  abstract = {ConspectusMolecular crystals are ubiquitous in many areas of science and engineering, including biology and medicine. Until recently, our ability to understand and predict their structure and properties using density functional theory was severely limited by the lack of approximate exchange?correlation functionals able to achieve sufficient accuracy. Here we show that there are many cases where the simple, minimally empirical pairwise correction scheme of Tkatchenko and Scheffler provides a useful prediction of the structure and properties of molecular crystals.After a brief introduction of the approach, we demonstrate its strength through some examples taken from our recent work. First, we show the accuracy of the approach using benchmark data sets of molecular complexes. Then we show its efficacy for structural determination using the hemozoin crystal, a challenging system possessing a wide range of strong and weak binding scenarios. Next, we show that it is equally useful for response properties by considering the elastic constants exhibited by the supramolecular diphenylalanine peptide solid and the infrared signature of water libration movements in brushite. Throughout, we emphasize lessons learned not only for the methodology but also for the chemistry and physics of the crystals in question.We further show that in many other scenarios where the simple pairwise correction scheme is not sufficiently accurate, one can go beyond it by employing a computationally inexpensive many-body dispersive approach that results in useful, quantitative accuracy, even in the presence of significant screening and/or multibody contributions to the dispersive energy. We explain the principles of the many-body approach and demonstrate its accuracy for benchmark data sets of small and large molecular complexes and molecular solids.},

Other thermal corrections to the sublimationenthalpy (the 2RT term) are reexamined. We compare the recently implemented exchange-hole dipole moment (XDM) model with other approaches in the literature to find that XDM roughly doubles the accuracy of DFT-D2 and non-local functionals in computed lattice energies (4.8 kJ/mol mean absolute error) while, at the same time, predicting cell geometries within less than 2\% of the experimental result on average.

  abstract = {Interatomic pairwise methods are currently among the most popular and accurate ways to include dispersion energy in density functional theory calculations. However, when applied to more than two atoms, these methods are still frequently perceived to be based on ad hoc assumptions, rather than a rigorous derivation from quantum mechanics. Starting from the adiabatic connection fluctuation-dissipation (ACFD) theorem, an exact expression for the electronic exchange-correlation energy, we demonstrate that the pairwise interatomic dispersion energy for an arbitrary collection of isotropic polarizable dipoles emerges from the second-order expansion of the ACFD formula upon invoking the random-phase approximation (RPA) or the full-potential approximation. Moreover, for a system of quantum harmonic oscillators coupled through a dipole-dipole potential, we prove the equivalence between the full interaction energy obtained from the Hamiltonian diagonalization and the ACFD-RPA correlation energy. This property makes the Hamiltonian diagonalization an efficient method for the calculation of the many-body dispersion energy. In addition, we show that the switching function used to damp the dispersion interaction at short distances arises from a short-range screened Coulomb potential, whose role is to account for the spatial spread of the individual atomic dipole moments. By using the ACFD formula, we gain a deeper understanding of the approximations made in the interatomic pairwise approaches, providing a powerful formalism for further development of accurate and efficient methods for the calculation of the dispersion energy.},

  abstract = {Describing dispersion forces
Dispersion or van der Waals interactions are attractive forces that arise from induced dipoles. They are not seen just in atoms and molecules but also in larger nanostructures and even macroscopic objects. Ambrosetti et al. created a qualitatively correct description of van der Waals interactions between polarizable nanostructures over a wide range of finite distances. This required delocalized electrons that have wavelike electron density fluctuations, unlike the more common approaches with dipoles fixed on atoms. Furthermore, the authors observed an enhancement in the nonlocality of the charge density response on the scale of 10 to 20 nm.
Science, this issue p. 1171
Recent experiments on noncovalent interactions at the nanoscale have challenged the basic assumptions of commonly used particle- or fragment-based models for describing van der Waals (vdW) or dispersion forces. We demonstrate that a qualitatively correct description of the vdW interactions between polarizable nanostructures over a wide range of finite distances can only be attained by accounting for the wavelike nature of charge density fluctuations. By considering a diverse set of materials and biological systems with markedly different dimensionalities, topologies, and polarizabilities, we find a visible enhancement in the nonlocality of the charge density response in the range of 10 to 20 nanometers. These collective wavelike fluctuations are responsible for the emergence of nontrivial modifications of the power laws that govern noncovalent interactions at the nanoscale.
The description of van der Waals interactions in nanostructures must include delocalized electron density fluctuations.

  abstract = {In this work, we report the results of a series of density functional theory (DFT) based ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations of ambient liquid water using a hierarchy of exchange-correlation (XC) functionals to investigate the individual and collective effects of exact exchange (Exx), via the PBE0 hybrid functional, non-local van der Waals/dispersion (vdW) interactions, via a fully self-consistent density-dependent dispersion correction, and an approximate treatment of nuclear quantum effects, via a 30 K increase in the simulation temperature, on the microscopic structure of liquid water. Based on these AIMD simulations, we found that the collective inclusion of Exx and vdW as resulting from a large-scale AIMD simulation of (H2O)128 significantly softens the structure of ambient liquid water and yields an oxygen-oxygen structure factor, S OO(Q), and corresponding oxygen-oxygen radial distribution function, g OO(r), that are now in quantitative agreement with the best available experimental data. This level of agreement between simulation and experiment demonstrated herein originates from an increase in the relative population of water molecules in the interstitial region between the first and second coordination shells, a collective reorganization in the liquid phase which is facilitated by a weakening of the hydrogen bond strength by the use of a hybrid XC functional, coupled with a relative stabilization of the resultant disordered liquid water configurations by the inclusion of non-local vdW/dispersion interactions. This increasingly more accurate description of the underlying hydrogen bond network in liquid water also yields higher-order correlation functions, such as the oxygen-oxygen-oxygen triplet angular distribution, P OOO(\texttheta), and therefore the degree of local tetrahedrality, as well as electrostatic properties, such as the effective molecular dipole moment, that are in much better agreement with experiment.},

  abstract = {The basis set convergence of energy differences obtained from the random phase approximation (RPA) to the correlation energy is investigated for a wide range of molecular interactions. For dispersion bound systems the basis set incompleteness error is most pronounced, as shown for the S22 benchmark [P. Jurecka et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.8, 1985 (2006)10.1039/b600027d]. The use of very large basis sets (\&gt; quintuple-zeta) or extrapolation to the complete basis set (CBS) limit is necessary to obtain a reliable estimate of the binding energy for these systems. Counterpoise corrected results converge to the same CBS limit, but counterpoise correction without extrapolation is insufficient. Core-valence correlations do not play a significant role. For medium- and short-range correlation, quadruple-zeta results are essentially converged, as demonstrated for relative alkane conformer energies, reaction energies dominated by intramolecular dispersion, isomerization energies, and reaction energies of small organic molecules. Except for weakly bound systems, diffuse augmentation almost universally slows down basis set convergence. For most RPA applications, quadruple-zeta valence basis sets offer a good balance between accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract = {The second-order M?ller?Plesset perturbation energy (MP2) and the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) correlation energy are increasingly popular post-Kohn?Sham correlation methods. Here, a novel algorithm based on a hybrid Gaussian and Plane Waves (GPW) approach with the resolution-of-identity (RI) approximation is developed for MP2, scaled opposite-spin MP2 (SOS-MP2), and direct-RPA (dRPA) correlation energies of finite and extended system. The key feature of the method is that the three center electron repulsion integrals (??|P) necessary for the RI approximation are computed by direct integration between the products of Gaussian basis functions ?? and the electrostatic potential arising from the RI fitting densities P. The electrostatic potential is obtained in a plane waves basis set after solving the Poisson equation in Fourier space. This scheme is highly efficient for condensed phase systems and offers a particularly easy way for parallel implementation. The RI approximation allows to speed up the MP2 energy calculations by a factor 10 to 15 compared to the canonical implementation but still requires O(N5) operations. On the other hand, the combination of RI with a Laplace approach in SOS-MP2 and an imaginary frequency integration in dRPA reduces the computational effort to O(N4) in both cases. In addition to that, our implementations have low memory requirements and display excellent parallel scalability up to tens of thousands of processes. Furthermore, exploiting graphics processing units (GPU), a further speedup by a factor ?2 is observed compared to the standard only CPU implementations. In this way, RI-MP2, RI-SOS-MP2, and RI-dRPA calculations for condensed phase systems containing hundreds of atoms and thousands of basis functions can be performed within minutes employing a few hundred hybrid nodes. In order to validate the presented methods, various molecular crystals have been employed as benchmark systems to assess the performance, while solid LiH has been used to study the convergence with respect to the basis set and system size in the case of RI-MP2 and RI-dRPA.},

  abstract = {We have studied the interaction of benzene with Cu(1 1 1), Ag(1 1 1) and Au(1 1 1) surfaces using density functional theory (DFT) within a generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and the van der Waals density functional [vdW-DF; M. Dion, H. Rydberg, E. Schr{\"o}der, D.C. Langreth, B.I. Lundqvist, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92 (2004) 246401]. The adsorption energies using vdW-DF are significantly more accurate than those using GGA, while the equilibrium adsorption distances between benzene and metal substrates ( Z C eq ) calculated by both GGA and vdW-DF are almost identical. The work function changes induced by the adsorption of benzene are significantly underestimated compared with the experimental values, as a result of the overestimation of Z C eq by both GGA and vdW-DF. Instead of determining the Z C eq values from first-principles calculations, we deduced the most probable adsorption distances in such a way as to reproduce the experimentally-observed work function changes. The deduced adsorption distance ( Z C ded ) is shortest on Cu(1 1 1) while it is longest on Ag(1 1 1), reflecting the strength of the interactions between benzene and the metal surfaces. It turns out that the substrate dependence of the work function change is mainly ascribed to the difference in the benzene\textendash{}metal distance (ZC). Charge transfer and work function changes by the adsorption of benzene were analyzed by means of the induced density of interface states (IDIS) model [H. V{\'a}zquez, R. Qszwaldowski, P. Pou, J. Ortega, R. P{\'e}rez, F. Flores, A. Kahn, Europhys. Lett. 65 (2004) 802], and compared with the self-consistent GGA calculations. The vacuum level shifts estimated by the IDIS model agree with the GGA results for Z C $\geqslant$ 0.3 nm . On the other hand, the discrepancy between the two methods becomes larger for Z C $\leqslant$ 0.3 nm , where the back donation from the metal substrates to the adsorbate becomes significant. We show that the IDIS model reasonably works well for benzene on Cu(1 1 1), Ag(1 1 1) and Au(1 1 1) surfaces because Z C ded $\approx$ 0.3 nm on all surfaces. However, our analysis reveals that the actual charge density redistribution induced by the adsorption of benzene is more complicated than that assumed in the IDIS model.},

Our calculations demonstrate that vdW interactions increase the binding energy by more than 0.70 eV for physisorbed systems (Cu, Ag and Au) and by an even larger amount for strongly bound systems (Pd, Pt, Rh and Ir). The collective response of the substrate electrons captured via the vdW surf method plays a significant role for most substrates, shortening the equilibrium distance by 0.25 {\AA} for Cu and decreasing the binding energy by 0.27 eV for Rh. The reliability of our results is assessed by comparison with calculations using the random-phase approximation including renormalized single excitations, and the experimental data from temperature-programmed desorption, microcalorimetry measurements and low-energy electron diffraction.},

Among these newly developed vdW-inclusive methods, interatomic vdW approaches that account for the nonlocal screening within the bulk [V. G. Ruiz, W. Liu, E. Zojer, M. Scheffler, and A. Tkatchenko, Phys. Rev. Lett.108, 146103 (2012)] and improved nonlocal functionals [J. Klime{\v s}, D. R. Bowler, and A. Michaelides, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter22, 022201 (2010)] have emerged as promising candidates to account efficiently and accurately for the lack of long-range vdW forces in most popular DFT exchange-correlation functionals. Here we have used these two approaches to compute benzene adsorption on a range of close-packed (111) surfaces upon which it either physisorbs (Cu, Ag, and Au) or chemisorbs (Rh, Pd, Ir, and Pt). We have thoroughly compared the performance between the two classes of vdW-inclusive methods and when available compared the results obtained with experimental data. By examining the computed adsorption energies, equilibrium distances, and binding curves we conclude that both methods allow for an accurate treatment of adsorption at equilibrium adsorbate-substrate distances. To this end, explicit inclusion of electrodynamic screening in the interatomic vdW scheme and optimized exchange functionals in the case of nonlocal vdW density functionals is mandatory. Nevertheless, some discrepancies are found between these two classes of methods at large adsorbate-substrate separations.},

It is also exact or nearly exact for a set of ``appropriate norms,'' including rare-gas atoms and nonbonded interactions. This strongly constrained and appropriately normed meta-GGA achieves remarkable accuracy for systems where the exact exchange-correlation hole is localized near its electron, and especially for lattice constants and weak interactions.},

  abstract = {The Minnesota family of exchange?correlation functionals, which consists of meta generalized gradient approximations (meta-GGAs) and global-hybrid meta-GGAs, has been successful for density functional calculations of molecular structure, properties, and thermochemistry, kinetics, noncovalent interactions, and spectroscopy. Here, we generalize the functional form by using range-separated hybrid meta-GGA exchange. We optimize a functional, called M11, with the new form against a broad database of energetic chemical properties and compare its performance to that of several other functionals, including previous Minnesota functionals. We require the percentage of Hartree?Fock exchange to be 100 at large interelectronic distance, and we find an optimum percentage of 42.8 at short range. M11 has good across-the-board performance and the smallest mean unsigned error over the whole test set of 332 data; it has especially good performance for main-group atomization energies, proton affinities, electron affinities, alkyl bond dissociation energies, barrier heights, noncovalent interaction energies, and charge-transfer electronic excitation.},

Similarly, the analogous RPA and rCCD correlation energies calculated from antisymmetrized two-electron integrals are identical to each other despite very different underlying working equations.

The effects of short-range correlation are investigated here in the local spin density (LSD) approximation and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). Results are presented for atoms, molecules, and jellium surfaces. It is found that (1) short-range correlation energies are less sensitive to the inclusion of density gradients than are full correlation energies, and (2) short-range correlation makes a surprisingly small contribution to surface and molecular atomization energies. In order to improve the accuracy of electronic-structure calculations, we therefore combine a GGA treatment of short-range correlation with a full RPA treatment of the exchange-correlation energy. This approach leads to jellium surface energies close to those of the LSD approximation for exchange and correlation together (but not for each separately).},

In order to discuss the stability problem of rare-gas crystals, theoretical expressions and numerical computations are proposed for both the cubic and hexagonal closed packed structures. It is shown that, far from being negligible, the long-range many-body contributions to the binding energy occur significantly up to much higher orders of perturbation than the first three ones computed so far.

  doi = {10.1002/jcc.20078},
  abstract = {An empirical method to account for van der Waals interactions in practical calculations with the density functional theory (termed DFT-D) is tested for a wide variety of molecular complexes. As in previous schemes, the dispersive energy is described by damped interatomic potentials of the form C6R-6. The use of pure, gradient-corrected density functionals (BLYP and PBE), together with the resolution-of-the-identity (RI) approximation for the Coulomb operator, allows very efficient computations for large systems. Opposed to previous work, extended AO basis sets of polarized TZV or QZV quality are employed, which reduces the basis set superposition error to a negligible extend. By using a global scaling factor for the atomic C6 coefficients, the functional dependence of the results could be strongly reduced. The ``double counting'' of correlation effects for strongly bound complexes is found to be insignificant if steep damping functions are employed. The method is applied to a total of 29 complexes of atoms and small molecules (Ne, CH4, NH3, H2O, CH3F, N2, F2, formic acid, ethene, and ethine) with each other and with benzene, to benzene, naphthalene, pyrene, and coronene dimers, the naphthalene trimer, coronene $\cdot$ H2O and four H-bonded and stacked DNA base pairs (AT and GC). In almost all cases, very good agreement with reliable theoretical or experimental results for binding energies and intermolecular distances is obtained. For stacked aromatic systems and the important base pairs, the DFT-D-BLYP model seems to be even superior to standard MP2 treatments that systematically overbind. The good results obtained suggest the approach as a practical tool to describe the properties of many important van der Waals systems in chemistry. Furthermore, the DFT-D data may either be used to calibrate much simpler (e.g., force-field) potentials or the optimized structures can be used as input for more accurate ab initio calculations of the interaction energies. \textcopyright{} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We investigate the role of hydrogen bond (HB) cooperativity, van der Waals (vdW) dispersion interactions, and quantum contributions to free energies, including anharmonicities through density functional theory and ab initio path integral simulations. Of these various factors, we find that the largest impact on structural stabilization comes from vdW interactions. HB cooperativity is the second largest contribution as the size of the stacked chain grows. Competing nuclear quantum effects make the net quantum contribution small but very sensitive to anharmonicities, vdW, and the number of HBs. Our results suggest that a reliable treatment of these systems can only be attained by considering all of these components.},

  doi = {10.1002/jcc.20495},
  abstract = {A new density functional (DF) of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) type for general chemistry applications termed B97-D is proposed. It is based on Becke's power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parameterized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C6 $\cdot$ R-6. A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common density functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported. The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on standard thermochemical benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked aromatic molecules and group II element clusters, and for the computation of molecular geometries. Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for standard functionals. In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean absolute deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol-1. The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the average CCSD(T) accuracy. The basic strategy in the development to restrict the density functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interatomic distances by damped C6 $\cdot$ R-6 terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions. As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient and accurate quantum chemical method for large systems where dispersion forces are of general importance. \textcopyright{} 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  volume = {116},
  doi = {10.1063/1.1424928},
  abstract = {An empirical method has been designed to account for the van der Waals interactions in practical molecular calculations with density functional theory. For each atom pair separated at a distance R, the method adds to the density functionalelectronic structure calculations an additional attraction energy E vdW =-f d (R)C 6 R -6 , where f d (R) is the damping function which equals to one at large value of R and zero at small value of R. The coefficients C 6 for pair interactions between hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms have been developed in this work by a least-square fitting to the molecular C 6 coefficients obtained from the dipole oscillator strength distribution method by Meath and co-workers. Two forms of the damping functions have been studied, with one dropping to zero at short distances much faster than the other. Four density functionals have been examined: Becke's three parameter hybrid functional with the Lee-Yang-Parr correlation functional, Becke's 1988 exchange functional with the LYP correlation functional, Becke's 1988 exchange functional with Perdew and Wang's 1991 (PW91) correlation functional, and PW91 exchange and correlation functional. The method has been applied to three systems where the van der Waals attractions are known to be important: rare-gas diatomic molecules, stacking of base pairs and polyalanines' conformation stabilities. The results show that this empirical method, with the damping function dropping to zero smoothly, provides a significant correction to both of the Becke's hybrid functional and the PW91 exchange and correlation functional. Results are comparable to the corresponding second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset calculations in many cases.},

  abstract = {The structures and relative energies of the three naturally occurring modifications of titanium dioxide (rutile, brookite and anatase) were investigated. For an accurate description, atom-pairwise dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) was applied. The DFT-D3 scheme was extended non-empirically to improve the description of Ti atoms in bulk systems. New dispersion coefficients were derived from TDDFT calculations for electrostatically embedded TiO 2 clusters. The dispersion coefficient \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0953-8984/24/42/424206/cm427549ieqn55.gif] \$C\_6\^$\backslash$mathrmTiTi\$ is reduced by a factor of 18 compared to the free atom. The three TiO 2 modifications were optimized in periodic plane-wave calculations with dispersion-corrected GGA (PBE, revPBE) and hybrid density functionals (PBE0, revPBE0). The calculated lattice parameters are in good agreement with experimental data, in particular the dispersion-corrected PBE0 and revPBE0 hybrid functionals. Although the observed relative stabilities could not be reproduced in all cases, dispersion corrections improve the results. For an accurate description of bulk metal oxides, London dispersion is a prominent force that should not be neglected when energies and structures are computed with DFT. Additionally, the influence of dispersion interactions on the relaxation of the TiO 2 (110) surface is investigated.},

  doi = {10.1063/1.4905259},
  abstract = {Van der Waals (vdW) coefficients can be accurately generated and understood by modelling the dynamic multipole polarizability of each interacting object. Accurate static polarizabilities are the key to accurate dynamic polarizabilities and vdW coefficients. In this work, we present and study in detail a hollow-sphere model for the dynamic multipole polarizability proposed recently by two of the present authors (JT and JPP) to simulate the vdW coefficients for inhomogeneous systems that allow for a cavity. The inputs to this model are the accurate static multipole polarizabilities and the electron density. A simplification of the full hollow-sphere model, the single-frequency approximation (SFA), circumvents the need for a detailed electron density and for a double numerical integration over space. We find that the hollow-sphere model in SFA is not only accurate for nanoclusters and cage molecules (e.g., fullerenes) but also yields vdW coefficients among atoms, fullerenes, and small clusters in good agreement with expensive time-dependent density functional calculations. However, the classical shell model (CSM), which inputs the static dipole polarizabilities and estimates the static higher-order multipole polarizabilities therefrom, is accurate for the higher-order vdW coefficients only when the interacting objects are large. For the lowest-order vdW coefficient C 6, SFA and CSM are exactly the same. The higher-order (C 8 and C 10) terms of the vdW expansion can be almost as important as the C 6 term in molecular crystals. Application to a variety of clusters shows that there is strong non-additivity of the long-range vdW interactions between nanoclusters.},

The inclusion of screened vdW interactions further improves the description of defect formation energies, significantly changes the barrier geometries, and brings migration barrier heights into close agreement with experimental values.

Here, first-principles calculations provide an alternative explanation based on free-energy differences at room temperature. The explicit consideration of many-body van der Waals interactions in the free energy demonstrates that the stability of the most abundant form of aspirin is due to a subtle coupling between collective electronic fluctuations and quantized lattice vibrations. In addition, a systematic analysis of the elastic properties of the two forms of aspirin rules out mechanical instability of form II as making it metastable.},

The method, denoted self-consistent dRPA method, furthermore treats exactly the exchange energy and the local multiplicative KS exchange potential. It uses Gaussian basis sets, is reasonably efficient, exhibiting a scaling of the computational effort with the forth power of the system size, and thus is generally applicable to molecules. The resulting dRPA correlation potentials in contrast to common approximate correlation potentials are in good agreement with exact reference potentials. The negatives of the eigenvalues of the highest occupied molecular orbitals are found to be in good agreement with experimental ionization potentials. Total energies from self-consistent dRPA calculations, as expected, are even poorer than non-self-consistent dRPA total energies and dRPA reaction and non-covalent binding energies do not significantly benefit from self-consistency. On the other hand, energies obtained with a recently introduced adiabatic-connection dissipation-fluctuation approach (EXXRPA+, exact-exchange random phase approximation) that takes into account, besides the Coulomb kernel, also the exact frequency-dependent exchange kernel are significantly improved if evaluated with orbitals obtained from a self-consistent dRPA calculation instead of an exact exchange-only calculation. Total energies, reaction energies, and noncovalent binding energies obtained in this way are of the same quality as those of high-level quantum chemistry methods, like the coupled cluster singles doubles method which is computationally more demanding.},

It exhibits a uniquely rich phenomenology including dramatic variations in behavior over the wide temperature range of the liquid into water's crystalline phases and amorphous states. We show that many-body responses arising from water's electronic structure are essential mechanisms harnessed by the molecule to encode for the distinguishing features of its condensed states. We treat the complete set of these many-body responses nonperturbatively within a coarse-grained electronic structure derived exclusively from single-molecule properties. Such a ``strong coupling'' approach generates interaction terms of all symmetries to all orders, thereby enabling unique transferability to diverse local environments such as those encountered along the coexistence curve. The symmetries of local motifs that can potentially emerge are not known a priori. Consequently, electronic responses unfiltered by artificial truncation are then required to embody the terms that tip the balance to the correct set of structures. Therefore, our fully responsive molecular model produces, a simple, accurate, and intuitive picture of water's complexity and its molecular origin, predicting water's signature physical properties from ice, through liquid\textendash{}vapor coexistence, to the critical point.},

  title = {Nonadditivity of Nanoparticle Interactions},
  volume = {350},
  doi = {10.1126/science.1242477},
  abstract = {Understanding interactions between inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) is central to comprehension of self-organization processes and a wide spectrum of physical, chemical, and biological phenomena. However, quantitative description of the interparticle forces is complicated by many obstacles that are not present, or not as severe, for microsize particles ($\mu$Ps). Here we analyze the sources of these difficulties and chart a course for future research. Such difficulties can be traced to the increased importance of discreteness and fluctuations around NPs (relative to $\mu$Ps) and to multiscale collective effects. Although these problems can be partially overcome by modifying classical theories for colloidal interactions, such an approach fails to manage the nonadditivity of electrostatic, van der Waals, hydrophobic, and other interactions at the nanoscale. Several heuristic rules identified here can be helpful for discriminating between additive and nonadditive nanoscale systems. Further work on NP interactions would benefit from embracing NPs as strongly correlated reconfigurable systems with diverse physical elements and multiscale coupling processes, which will require new experimental and theoretical tools. Meanwhile, the similarity between the size of medium constituents and NPs makes atomic simulations of their interactions increasingly practical. Evolving experimental tools can stimulate improvement of existing force fields. New scientific opportunities for a better understanding of the electronic origin of classical interactions are converging at the scale of NPs.
BACKGROUND Interactions between inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) are central to a wide spectrum of physical, chemical, and biological phenomena. An understanding of these interactions is essential for technological implementation of nanoscale synthesis and engineering of self-organized NP superstructures with various dimensionalities, collective properties at the nanoscale, and predictive biological responses to NPs. However, the quantitative description of NP forces encounters many obstacles not present, or not as severe, for microsize particles ($\mathrm{\mu}$Ps). These difficulties are revealed in multiple experimental observations that are, unfortunately, not fully recognized as of yet. Inconsistencies in the accounting of NP interactions are observed across all material platforms that include ceramic, semiconductor, and metallic NPs; crystalline and amorphous NPs; as well as dispersions of inorganic, organic, and biological nanomaterials. Such systematic deviations of theoretical predictions from reality point to the generality of such phenomena for nanoscale matter. Here we analyze the sources of these inconsistencies and chart a course for future research that might overcome these challenges.
ADVANCES Nanoparticle interactions are often described by classical colloidal theories developed for $\mathrm{\mu}$Ps. However, several foundational assumptions of these theories, while tolerable for microscale dispersions, fail for NPs. For example, the sizes of ions, solvent molecules, and NPs can be within one order of magnitude of each other, which inherently disallows continuum approximations. Fluctuations of ionic atmospheres, ion-specific effects, enhanced NP anisometry, and multiscale collective effects become essential for accurate accounting of NP interactions. The nonuniformity of the stabilizing layer adds another essential contradistinction. When the particle size becomes smaller than a few tens of nanometers and the gaps between particles become smaller than a few nanometers, nonadditivity of electrostatic (Vel), van der Waals (VvdW), hydrophobic (Vhph), and other potentials (V${'}$) emerges. In fact, it becomes impossible to cleanly decompose the potential of mean force (PMF) for the interaction of two NPs into separate additive contributions from these interactions\textemdash{}as in, e.g., classical Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory [V(r) = Vel(r)+ VvdW(r)+ Vhph(r)+ V${'}$(r)]\textemdash{}due to the coupled structural dynamics of neighboring NPs and surrounding media. Experimentally, the nonadditivity of NP interactions was observed long ago as an unusually high colloidal stability of NP dispersions, defying all reasonable predictions based on DLVO and other classical theories. It also manifests itself in paradoxical phase behavior, self-assembly into sophisticated superstructures, complex collective behavior, enigmatic toxicology, and protein-mimetic behavior of inorganic NPs. Molecular dynamics simulations of PMFs computed for NP pairs confirm the nonadditivity of van der Waals and electrostatic interactions for nanometer-scale separations.
OUTLOOK Further work in the field of NP interactions should perhaps embrace NPs as strongly correlated reconfigurable systems with diverse physical elements and multiscale coupling processes, which will require new experimental and theoretical tools. Meanwhile, several heuristic rules identified in this Review can be helpful for discriminating between the systems in which mean-field theories can and cannot be applied. These precepts can guide qualitative thinking about NP interactions, stimulate further research into NP interactions, and aid in their design for applications. Though it is the crux of nonadditivity, the similarity in size between the ions and molecules composing the solvent medium and the NP offers a silver lining: it makes atomic simulations of their interactions increasingly practical as computer speed increases. The direct determination of the PMF by atom$\-$istic simulation bypasses the enumeration of individual forces and therefore resolves the nonadditivity problem. In fact, NPs present a favorable system for atomistic simulations because solid inorganic cores have many fewer degrees of freedom than flexible organic chains. Improvements in force fields are necessary to adequately account for intermolecular interactions, entropic contributions, dispersion interactions between atoms, high polarizability of inorganic materials, and quantum confinement effects. Evolving experimental tools that can accurately examine interactions at the nanoscale should help to validate the simulations and stimulate improvement of relevant force fields. In fact, new opportunities for better understanding of the electronic origin of classical interactions are likely as the rapidly improving capabilities in synthesis, simulations, and imaging converge at the scale of NPs. View larger version: In this page In a new window Download PowerPoint Slide for Teaching Schematics of hydrated ions, a NP, and a $\mathrm{\mu}$P, demonstrating the structural uniqueness and discreteness of NPs.Nonadditivity of NP interactions stems from the size similarity of reconfigurable structural elements of NPs (i.e., surface ligands, ionic atmosphere, adsorbed molecules, etc.) and the surrounding media, leading to their strongly coupled dynamics. The high polarizability and faceting that are typical of NPs\textemdash{}as well as collective multibody effects at atomic, molecular, and nanometer scales\textemdash{}lead to the enhancement of nonadditivity and result in interdependence of electrostatic, van der Waals, hydrophobic, and other forces.
Solutions for nanoparticle solutions
Nanoparticle interactions in solution affect their binding to biomolecules, their electronic properties, and their packing into larger crystals. However, the theories that describe larger colloidal particles fail for nanoparticles, because the interactions do not add together linearly. Nanoparticles also have complex shapes and are closer in size to the solvent molecules. Silvera Batista et al. review approaches that can treat the nonadditive nature of nanoparticle interactions, resulting in a more complete understanding of nanoparticles in solution.

  abstract = {Within the framework of density functional theory, the inclusion of exact exchange and non-local van der Waals/dispersion (vdW) interactions is crucial for predicting a microscopic structure of ambient liquid water that quantitatively agrees with experiment. In this work, we have used the local structure index (LSI) order parameter to analyse the local structure in such highly accurate ab initio liquid water. At ambient conditions, the LSI probability distribution, P(I ), was unimodal with most water molecules characterised by more disordered high-density-like local environments. With thermal excitations removed, the resultant bimodal P(I ) in the inherent potential energy surface (IPES) exhibited a 3:1 ratio between high-density- and low-density-like molecules, with the latter forming small connected clusters amid the predominant population. By considering the spatial correlations and hydrogen bond network topologies among water molecules with the same LSI identities, we demonstrate that the signatures of the experimentally observed low- and high-density amorphous phases of ice are present in the IPES of ambient liquid water. Analysis of the LSI autocorrelation function uncovered a persistence time of $\sim$ 4 ps \textendash{} a finding consistent with the fact that natural thermal fluctuations are responsible for transitions between these distinct yet transient local aqueous environments in ambient liquid water.},

  abstract = {Electronic structure approaches for calculating intermolecular interactions have traditionally been benchmarked almost exclusively on the basis of energy-centric metrics. Herein, we explore the idea of utilizing a metric related to geometry. On a diverse series of noncovalently interacting systems of different sizes, from the water dimer to the coronene dimer, we evaluate a variety of electronic structure approximations with respect to their abilities to reproduce coupled-cluster-level geometries. Specifically, we examine Hartree?Fock, second-order M?ller?Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), attenuated MP2, scaled MP2, and a number of density functionals, many of which include empirical or nonempirical van der Waals dispersion corrections. We find a number of trends that transcend system size and interaction type. For instance, functionals incorporating VV10 nonlocal correlation tend to yield highly accurate geometries; ?B97X-V and B97M-V, in particular, stand out. We establish that intermolecular distance, as measured by, e.g., the center-of-mass separation of two molecules, is the geometric parameter that deviates most profoundly among the various methods. This property of the equilibrium intermolecular separation, coupled with its accessibility via a small series of well-defined single-point calculations, makes it an ideal metric for the development and evaluation of electronic structure methods.},

  abstract = {Mean-field electronic structure methods like Hartree\textendash{}Fock, semilocal density functional approximations, or semiempirical molecular orbital (MO) theories do not account for long-range electron correlation (London dispersion interaction). Inclusion of these effects is mandatory for realistic calculations on large or condensed chemical systems and for various intramolecular phenomena (thermochemistry). This Review describes the recent developments (including some historical aspects) of dispersion corrections with an emphasis on methods that can be employed routinely with reasonable accuracy in large-scale applications. The most prominent correction schemes are classified into three groups: (i) nonlocal, density-based functionals, (ii) semiclassical C6-based, and (iii) one-electron effective potentials. The properties as well as pros and cons of these methods are critically discussed, and typical examples and benchmarks on molecular complexes and crystals are provided. Although there are some areas for further improvement (robustness, many-body and short-range effects), the situation regarding the overall accuracy is clear. Various approaches yield long-range dispersion energies with a typical relative error of 5\%. For many chemical problems, this accuracy is higher compared to that of the underlying mean-field method (i.e., a typical semilocal (hybrid) functional like B3LYP).},

  abstract = {Geckos have evolved one of the most versatile and effective adhesives known. The mechanism of dry adhesion in the millions of setae on the toes of geckos has been the focus of scientific study for over a century. We provide the first direct experimental evidence for dry adhesion of gecko setae by van der Waals forces, and reject the use of mechanisms relying on high surface polarity, including capillary adhesion. The toes of live Tokay geckos were highly hydrophobic, and adhered equally well to strongly hydrophobic and strongly hydrophilic, polarizable surfaces. Adhesion of a single isolated gecko seta was equally effective on the hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces of a microelectro-mechanical systems force sensor. A van der Waals mechanism implies that the remarkable adhesive properties of gecko setae are merely a result of the size and shape of the tips, and are not strongly affected by surface chemistry. Theory predicts greater adhesive forces simply from subdividing setae to increase surface density, and suggests a possible design principle underlying the repeated, convergent evolution of dry adhesive microstructures in gecko, anoles, skinks, and insects. Estimates using a standard adhesion model and our measured forces come remarkably close to predicting the tip size of Tokay gecko seta. We verified the dependence on size and not surface type by using physical models of setal tips nanofabricated from two different materials. Both artificial setal tips stuck as predicted and provide a path to manufacturing the first dry, adhesive microstructures.},

This negligence is due to the common notion that dispersion is weak, which is only true for one pair of interacting atoms. For increasingly larger structures, the overall dispersion contribution grows rapidly and can amount to tens of kcal\,mol-1. This Review collects and emphasizes the importance of inter- and intramolecular dispersion for molecules consisting mostly of first row atoms. The synergy of experiment and theory has now reached a stage where dispersion effects can be examined in fine detail. This forces us to reconsider our perception of steric hindrance and stereoelectronic effects. The quantitation of dispersion energy donors will improve our ability to design sophisticated molecular structures and much better catalysts.},

  abstract = {In this work, the solvation and electronic structure of the aqueous chloride ion solution was investigated using density functional theory (DFT) based ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). From an analysis of radial distribution functions, coordination numbers, and solvation structures, we found that exact exchange (Exx) and non-local van der Waals (vdW) interactions effectively weaken the interactions between the Cl- ion and the first solvation shell. With a Cl\textendash{}O coordination number in excellent agreement with experiment, we found that most configurations generated with vdW-inclusive hybrid DFT exhibit sixfold coordinated distorted trigonal prism structures, which is indicative of a significantly disordered first solvation shell. By performing a series of band structure calculations on configurations generated from AIMD simulations with varying DFT potentials, we found that the solvated ion orbital energy levels (unlike the band structure of liquid water) strongly depend on the underlying molecular structures. In addition, these orbital energy levels were also significantly affected by the DFT functional employed for the electronic structure; as the fraction of Exx was increased, the gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital of Cl- and the valence band maximum of liquid water steadily increased towards the experimental value.},

  abstract = {Many-body noncovalent interactions are increasingly important in large and/or condensed-phase systems, but the current understanding of how well various models predict these interactions is limited. Here, benchmark complete-basis set coupled cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) calculations have been performed to generate a new test set for three-body intermolecular interactions. This ``3B-69'' benchmark set includes three-body interaction energies for 69 total trimer structures, consisting of three structures from each of 23 different molecular crystals. By including structures that exhibit a variety of intermolecular interactions and packing arrangements, this set provides a stringent test for the ability of electronic structure methods to describe the correct physics involved in the interactions. Both MP2.5 (the average of second- and third-order M{\o}ller\textendash{}Plesset perturbation theory) and spin-component-scaled CCSD for noncovalent interactions (SCS-MI-CCSD) perform well. MP2 handles the polarization aspects reasonably well, but it omits three-body dispersion. In contrast, many widely used density functionals corrected with three-body D3 dispersion correction perform comparatively poorly. The primary difficulty stems from the treatment of exchange and polarization in the functionals rather than from the dispersion correction, though the three-body dispersion may also be moderately underestimated by the D3 correction.},

  volume = {7},

  abstract = {An accurate treatment of the long-range electron correlation energy, including van der Waals (vdW) or dispersion interactions, is essential for describing the structure, dynamics, and function of a wide variety of systems. Among the most accurate models for including dispersion into density functional theory (DFT) is the range-separated many-body dispersion (MBD) method [A. Ambrosetti et al., J. Chem. Phys., 2014, 140, 18A508], in which the correlation energy is modeled at short-range by a semi-local density functional and at long-range by a model system of coupled quantum harmonic oscillators. In this work, we develop analytical gradients of the MBD energy with respect to nuclear coordinates, including all implicit coordinate dependencies arising from the partitioning of the charge density into Hirshfeld effective volumes. To demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of these MBD gradients for geometry optimizations of systems with intermolecular and intramolecular interactions, we optimized conformers of the benzene dimer and isolated small peptides with aromatic side-chains. We find excellent agreement with the wavefunction theory reference geometries of these systems (at a fraction of the computational cost) and find that MBD consistently outperforms the popular TS and D3(BJ) dispersion corrections. To demonstrate the performance of the MBD model on a larger system with supramolecular interactions, we optimized the C60@C60H28 buckyball catcher host\textendash{}guest complex. In our analysis, we also find that neglecting the implicit nuclear coordinate dependence arising from the charge density partitioning, as has been done in prior numerical treatments, leads to an unacceptable error in the MBD forces, with relative errors of $\sim$20\% (on average) that can extend well beyond 100\%.},

  abstract = {A largely unsolved problem in computational biochemistry is the accurate prediction of binding affinities of small ligands to protein receptors. We present a detailed analysis of the systematic and random errors present in computational methods through the use of error probability density functions, specifically for computed interaction energies between chemical fragments comprising a protein-ligand complex. An HIV-II protease crystal structure with a bound ligand (indinavir) was chosen as a model protein-ligand complex. The complex was decomposed into 21 interacting fragment pairs, which were studied using a number of computational methods. The chemically accurate complete basis set coupled cluster theory (CCSD(T)/CBS) interaction energies were used as reference values to generate our error estimates. In our analysis, we observed significant systematic and random errors in most methods, which was surprising, especially for parametrized classical and semiempirical quantum mechanical calculations. After propagating these fragment-based error estimates over the entire protein-ligand complex, our total error estimates for many methods are large compared to the experimentally determined free energy of binding. Thus, we conclude that statistical error analysis is a necessary addition to any scoring function attempting to produce reliable binding affinity predictions.},

PBE-XDM coupled with the relatively economical and efficient pc-2-spd basis set gives excellent statistics (mean absolute error (MAE) = 1.5 kcal/mol), below the deviation between experimental and QMC data. When compared only to the (more accurate) QMC results, PBE-XDM/pc-2-spd (MAE = 1.2 kcal/mol) outperforms all other dispersion-corrected DFT results in the literature, including PBE-dDsC/QZ4P (6.2 kcal/mol), PBE-NL/def2-QZVP (4.7 kcal/mol), PBE-D2/def2-QZVP${'}$ (3.5 kcal/mol), PBE-D3/def2-QZVP${'}$(2.3 kcal/mol), M06-L/def2-QZVP (1.9 kcal/mol), and PBE-MBD (1.8 kcal/mol), with no significant bias (mean error (ME) = 0.04 kcal/mol).

The dipole\textendash{}quadrupole and quadrupole\textendash{}quadrupole pairwise dispersion terms (C8 and C10) are critical for the correct description of the dimers. XDM-corrected functionals different from PBE that work well for small dimers do not yield good accuracy for the large supramolecular systems in the S12L, presenting errors that scale linearly with the dispersion contribution to the binding energy.},

  abstract = {Reliable thermochemical measurements and theoretical predictions for reactions involving large transition metal complexes in which long-range intramolecular London dispersion interactions contribute significantly to their stabilization are still a challenge, particularly for reactions in solution. As an illustrative and chemically important example, two reactions are investigated where a large dipalladium complex is quenched by bulky phosphane ligands (triphenylphosphane and tricyclohexylphosphane). Reaction enthalpies and Gibbs free energies were measured by isotherm titration calorimetry (ITC) and theoretically `back-corrected' to yield 0\hspace{0.25em}K gas-phase reaction energies ($\Delta$E). It is shown that the Gibbs free solvation energy calculated with continuum models represents the largest source of error in theoretical thermochemistry protocols. The (`back-corrected') experimental reaction energies were used to benchmark (dispersion-corrected) density functional and wave function theory methods. Particularly, we investigated whether the atom-pairwise D3 dispersion correction is also accurate for transition metal chemistry, and how accurately recently developed local coupled-cluster methods describe the important long-range electron correlation contributions. Both, modern dispersion-corrected density functions (e.g., PW6B95-D3(BJ) or B3LYP-NL), as well as the now possible DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculations, are within the `experimental' gas phase reference value. The remaining uncertainties of 2\textendash{}3\hspace{0.25em}kcal\,mol-1 can be essentially attributed to the solvation models. Hence, the future for accurate theoretical thermochemistry of large transition metal reactions in solution is very promising.},

The oxygen-hydrogen contribution to the measured x-ray scattering pattern was subtracted using literature data to yield an experimental determination, with error bars, of the oxygen-oxygen pair-distribution function, g OO (r), which essentially describes the distribution of molecular centers. The extended Q-range and low statistical noise of these measurements has significantly reduced truncation effects and related errors in the g OO (r) functions obtained.

  volume = {79},
  doi = {10.1103/PhysRevA.79.042510},
  abstract = {One of the major deficiencies of the standard density functionals is their inability to describe dispersion interactions. Becke and Johnson recently proposed a conceptually simple yet accurate dispersion model called the exchange-dipole moment (XDM) model, which allows the calculation of both intermolecular and intramolecular dispersion interactions with density functional theory (DFT). In this paper, we present an efficient self-consistent-field (SCF) solution of the XDM model. We also give detailed analysis of the post-SCF approach in which the dispersion term is added to the Hamiltonian as a perturbation, and show that it has an error on the order of 10-5 in density matrix due to the addition of dispersion to the Hamiltonian. In addition, for gradient calculations with respect to the atomic movement, we introduce a further approximation in which the electronic part of the XDM gradient formula is omitted, and show that it yields an error smaller than 10-3 a.u. These approximations offer a simple and efficient route with good precision for the implementation of XDM model and other dispersion models into existing DFT codes. The effectiveness of our implementation is demonstrated through several examples. The first example shows that inclusion of the XDM model leads to much more accurate prediction of enthalpies of formation of straight-chain alkanes than does the Becke three-parameter Lee-Yang-Parr (B3LYP) functional. The inclusion of the dispersion is also shown to improve the accuracy in the calculation of isomerization energies and bond-dissociation energies of alkanes. The last example shows that the qualitative difference in optimal geometries of a tyrosine-glycine peptide, calculated using the B3LYP functional and the second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset method, essentially disappears when XDM is added to the DFT calculation.},

  abstract = {Recently introduced local response dispersion method [T. Sato and H. Nakai, J. Chem. Phys.131, 224104 (2009)], which is a first-principles alternative to empirical dispersion corrections in density functional theory, is implemented with generalized multicenter interactions involving both atomic and atomic pair polarizabilities. The generalization improves the asymptote of intermolecular interactions, reducing the mean absolute percentage error from about 30\% to 6\% in the molecular C 6 coefficients of more than 1000 dimers, compared to experimental values. The method is also applied to calculations of potential energy curves of molecules in the S22 database [P. Jure{\v c}ka et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.8, 1985 (2006)]. The calculated potential energy curves are in a good agreement with reliable benchmarks recently published by Molnar et al. [J. Chem. Phys.131, 065102 (2009)]. These improvements are achieved at the price of increasing complexity in the implementation, but without losing the computational efficiency of the previous two-center (atom-atom) formulation. A set of different truncations of two-center and three- or four-center interactions is shown to be optimal in the cost-performance balance.},

In order to tackle this problem, we have developed a method within density-functional theory (DFT) to model screened van der Waals interactions (vdW) for atoms and molecules on surfaces (the so-called DFT+vdWsurf method). The relatively high accuracy of the DFT+vdWsurf method in the calculation of both adsorption distances and energies, as well as the high degree of its reliability across a wide range of adsorbates, indicates the importance of the collective electronic effects within the extended substrate for the calculation of the vdW energy tail. We examine in detail the theoretical background of the method and assess its performance for adsorption phenomena including the physisorption of Xe on selected close-packed transition metal surfaces and 3,4,9,10-perylene-tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride (PTCDA) on Au(111). We also address the performance of DFT+vdWsurf in the case of non-close-packed surfaces by studying the adsorption of Xe on Cu(110) and the interfaces formed by the adsorption of a PTCDA monolayer on the Ag(111), Ag(100), and Ag(110) surfaces. We conclude by discussing outstanding challenges in the modeling of vdW interactions for studying atomic and molecular adsorbates on inorganic substrates.},

  abstract = {The S12L test set for supramolecular Gibbs free energies of association $\Delta$Ga (Grimme, S. Chem. Eur. J. 2012, 18, 9955-9964) is extended to 30 complexes (S30L), featuring more diverse interaction motifs, anions, and higher charges (-1 up to +4) as well as larger systems with up to 200 atoms. Various typical noncovalent interactions like hydrogen and halogen bonding, $\uppi$\textendash$\uppi$ stacking, nonpolar dispersion, and CH-$\uppi$ and cation\textendash{}dipolar interactions are represented by ``real'' complexes. The experimental Gibbs free energies of association ($\Delta$Gaexp) cover a wide range from -0.7 to -24.7 kcal mol\textendash{}1. In order to obtain a theoretical best estimate for $\Delta$Ga, we test various dispersion corrected density functionals in combination with quadruple-$\zeta$ basis sets for calculating the association energies in the gas phase. Further, modern semiempirical methods are employed to obtain the thermostatistical corrections from energy to Gibbs free energy, and the COSMO-RS model with several parametrizations as well as the SMD model are used to include solvation contributions. We investigate the effect of including counterions for the charged systems (S30L-CI), which is found to overall improve the results. Our best method combination consists of PW6B95-D3 (for neutral and charged systems) or $\omega$B97X-D3 (for systems with counterions) energies, HF-3c thermostatistical corrections, and Gibbs free energies of solvation obtained with the COSMO-RS 2012 parameters for nonpolar solvents and 2013-fine for water. This combination gives a mean absolute deviation for $\Delta$Ga of only 2.4 kcal mol\textendash{}1 (S30L) and 2.1 kcal mol\textendash{}1 (S30L-CI), with a mean deviation of almost zero compared to experiment. Regarding the relative Gibbs free energies of association for the 13 pairs of complexes which share the same host, the correct trend in binding affinities could be reproduced except for two cases. The MAD compared to experiment amounts to 1.2 kcal mol\textendash{}1, and the MD is almost zero. The best-estimate theoretical corrections are used to back-correct the experimental $\Delta$Ga values in order to get an empirical estimate for the ``experimental'', zero-point vibrational energy exclusive, gas phase binding energies. These are then utilized to benchmark the performance of various ``low-cost'' quantum chemical methods for noncovalent interactions in large systems. The performance of other common DFT methods as well as the use of semiempirical methods for structure optimizations is discussed.},

  doi = {10.1063/1.1433747},
  abstract = {We have developed and investigated a dipole interaction model for calculating the polarizability of molecular clusters. The model has been parametrized from the frequency-dependent molecular polarizability as obtained from quantum chemical calculations for a series of 184 aliphatic, aromatic, and heterocyclic compounds. A damping of the interatomic interaction at short distances is introduced in such a way as to retain a traceless interaction tensor and a good description of the damping over a wide range of interatomic distances. By adopting atomic polarizabilities in addition to atom-type parameters describing the damping and the frequency dependence, respectively, the model is found to reproduce the molecular frequency-dependent polarizabilitytensor calculated with ab initio methods. A study of the polarizability of four dimers has been carried out: the hydrogen fluoride, methane, benzene, and urea dimers. We find in general good agreement between the model and the quantum chemical results over a wide range of intermolecular distances. To demonstrate the power of the model, the polarizability has been calculated for a linear chain of urea molecules with up to 300 molecules and one- and two-dimensional clusters of C 60 with up to 25 molecules. Substantial intermolecular contributions are found for the polarizabilityanisotropy, whereas the effects are small for the mean polarizability. For the mean polarizability of C 60 , we find good agreement between the model and experiments both in the case of an isolated molecule and in a comparison of a planar cluster of 25 C 60 molecules with experimental results on thin films.},

The triwire nonadditive dispersion for 1D electron gases scales according to the power law d-$\beta$, where d is the wire separation, with exponents $\beta$(rs) smaller than 3 and slightly increasing with rs from 2.4 at rs=1 to 2.9 at rs=10, where rs is the density parameter of the 1D electron gas. This is in good agreement with the exponent $\beta$=3 suggested by the leading-order charge-flow contribution to the triwire nonadditivity, and is a significantly slower decay than the $\sim$d-7 behavior that would be expected from triple-dipole summations.},

  abstract = {Surface energies are commonly used to determine the adhesion forces between materials. However, the component of surface energy derived from long-range forces, such as van der Waals forces, depends on the material's structure below the outermost atomic layers. Previous theoretical results and indirect experimental evidence suggest that the van der Waals energies of subsurface layers will influence interfacial adhesion forces. We discovered that nanometre-scale differences in the oxide layer thickness of silicon wafers result in significant macroscale differences in the adhesion of isolated gecko setal arrays. Si/SiO2 bilayer materials exhibited stronger adhesion when the SiO2 layer is thin (approx. 2 nm). To further explore how layered materials influence adhesion, we functionalized similar substrates with an octadecyltrichlorosilane monolayer and again identified a significant influence of the SiO2 layer thickness on adhesion. Our theoretical calculations describe how variation in the SiO2 layer thickness produces differences in the van der Waals interaction potential, and these differences are reflected in the adhesion mechanics. Setal arrays used as tribological probes provide the first empirical evidence that the `subsurface energy' of inhomogeneous materials influences the macroscopic surface forces.},

After nearly a century of anatomical description, here we report the first direct measurements of single setal force by using a two-dimensional micro-electro-mechanical systems force sensor and a wire as a force gauge. Measurements revealed that a seta is ten times more effective at adhesion than predicted from maximal estimates on whole animals. Adhesive force values support the hypothesis that individual seta operate by van der Waals forces. The gecko's peculiar behaviour of toe uncurling and peeling led us to discover two aspects of setal function which increase their effectiveness. A unique macroscopic orientation and preloading of the seta increased attachment force 600-fold above that of frictional measurements of the material. Suitably orientated setae reduced the forces necessary to peel the toe by simply detaching above a critical angle with the substratum.},

We find the longer molecules (n = 10,15) to be firmly $\alpha$-helical in character. For n = 5, calculated free-energy differences show different H-bond networks to still compete closely.

The investigated functionals tend to give interlayer binding energies higher than the RPA benchmark, and the overall performance for lattice constants is good. The exchange functionals optB86b and cx13 paired with the original vdW-DF and the B86R functional paired with vdW-DF2 are found to give particularly good results for equilibrium geometries.},

For the purpose of validation, we first compare to published, high-level benchmark conformational energy hierarchies (coupled cluster at the singles, doubles, and perturbative triples level, CCSD(T)) for 73 conformers of small three-residue peptides, establishing that the van der Waals corrected PBE0 functional yields an average error of only $\sim$20 meV ($\sim$0.5 kcal/mol). This compares to $\sim$40\textendash{}50 meV for nondispersion corrected PBE0 and 40\textendash{}100 meV for different empirical force fields (estimated for the alanine tetrapeptide). For longer peptide chains that form a secondary structure, CCSD(T) level benchmark data are currently unaffordable. We thus turn to the experimentally well studied Ac-Phe-Ala5-LysH+ peptide, for which four closely competing conformers were established by infrared spectroscopy. For comparison, an exhaustive theoretical conformational space exploration yields at least 11 competing low energy minima. We show that (i) the many-body dispersion correction, (ii) the hybrid functional nature of PBE0+MBD*, and (iii) zero-point corrections are needed to reveal the four experimentally observed structures as the minima that would be populated at low temperature.},

New sum rules for the nonlinear response tensors are also obtained, after consideration of the long-range limit. A perturbation analysis gives the dispersion-induced polarization in each molecule in terms of nonlocal, nonlinear response tensors taken at imaginary frequencies. Forces on the nuclei are computed from a reaction-field expression for the dispersion energy, in terms of polarizability densities. Recent work has shown that the derivative of the polarizability density with respect to a nuclear coordinate is linked to an integral involving the nonlinear response tensor and the dipole propagator, and this link provides the key to the proof.},

For the trimers for which we were able to compute CCSD(T) energies, we obtain a sizeable difference of 0.63 kcal mol-1 between the CCSD(T) and MP2 three-body contributions to the lattice energy, confirming that three-body dispersion dominates over three-body induction. Taking this difference as an estimate of three-body dispersion for the closer trimers, and adding an Axilrod-Teller-Muto estimate of 0.13 kcal mol-1 for long-range contributions yields an overall value of 0.76 kcal mol-1 for three-body dispersion, a significantly smaller value than in several recent studies.},

The calculations are based on London and Axilrod\textendash{}Teller\textendash{}Muto expressions where the required interatomic dispersion energy coefficients, C 6 and C 9 , are computed ``on the fly'' from the electron density. Inter- and intramolecular energy contributions are obtained using the Tang\textendash{}Toennies (TT) damping function for short interatomic distances. The TT range parameters are equally extracted on the fly from the electron density using their linear relationship to van der Waals radii. This relationship is empiricially determined for all the combinations of He\textendash{}Xe rare gas dimers, as well as for the He and Ar trimers. The investigated systems include the S22 database of noncovalent interactions, Ar, benzene and ice crystals, bilayer graphene, C 60 dimer, a peptide ( Ala 10 ) , an intercalated drug-DNA model [ellipticine- d ( CG ) 2 ], 42 DNA base pairs, a protein (DHFR, 2616 atoms), double stranded DNA (1905 atoms), and 12 molecular crystal polymorphs from crystal structure prediction blind test studies. The two- and three-body interatomic dispersion energies are found to contribute significantly to binding and cohesive energies, for bilayer graphene the latter reaches 50\% of experimentally derived binding energy. These results suggest that interatomic three-body dispersion potentials should be accounted for in atomistic simulations when modeling bulky molecules or condensed phase systems.},

The T-shaped structure was found to be a low-energy saddle point for interconversion between parallel displaced structures, while the planar sandwich structure was found to be a saddle point on a higher-energy interconversion path between parallel displaced structures. Detailed analysis of the low-energy (T-shaped saddle point) path revealed the presence of a shallow minimum corresponding to a tilt angle between phenyl ring planes of about 45$^\circ$. Much of the behavior of the benzene dimer observed through molecular jet spectroscopy can be explained by considering a population of the low-energy parallel displaced structure and structures along the low-energy interconversion path, including the tilt- and T-shaped structures.},

The inclusion of electron correlation increases attraction significantly. The dispersion interaction is found to be the major source of attraction in the benzene dimer. The orientation dependence of the dimer interaction is mainly controlled by long-range interactions.

  abstract = {State-of-the-art electronic structure theory has been applied to generate potential energy curves for the sandwich, T-shaped, and parallel-displaced configurations of the simplest prototype of aromatic $\uppi$-$\uppi$ interactions, the benzene dimer. Results were obtained using second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) and coupled-cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] with different augmented, correlation-consistent basis sets. At the MP2 level, the smallest basis set used (a modified aug-cc-pVDZ basis) underestimates the binding by $\sim$0.5 kcal mol-1 at equilibrium and by $\sim$1 kcal mol-1 at smaller intermonomer distances compared to results with a modified aug-cc-pVQZ basis (denoted aug-cc-pVQZ*). The best MP2 binding energies differ from the more accurate CCSD(T) values by up to 2.0 kcal mol-1 at equilibrium and by more than 2.5 kcal mol-1 at smaller intermonomer distances, highlighting the importance of going beyond MP2 to achieve higher accuracy in binding energies. Symmetry adapted perturbation theory is used to analyze interaction energies in terms of electrostatic, dispersion, induction, and exchange-repulsion contributions. The high-quality estimates of the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ* potential energy curves for the benzene dimer presented here provide a better understanding of how the strength of $\uppi$-$\uppi$ interactions varies with distance and orientation of the rings and will assist in the development of approximate methods capable of modeling weakly bound $\uppi$-$\uppi$ systems.},

  abstract = {Accurate binding energies of the benzene dimer at the T and parallel displaced (PD) configurations were determined using the single- and double-coupled cluster method with perturbative triple correction (CCSD(T)) with correlation-consistent basis sets and an effective basis set extrapolation scheme recently devised. The difference between the estimated CCSD(T) basis set limit electronic binding energies for the T and PD shapes appears to amount to more than 0.3 kcal/mol, indicating the PD shape is a more stable configuration than the T shape for this dimer in the gas phase. This conclusion is further strengthened when a vibrational zero-point correction to the electronic binding energies of this dimer is made, which increases the difference between the two configurations to 0.4-0.5 kcal/mol. The binding energies of 2.4 and 2.8 kcal/mol for the T and PD configurations are in good accord with the previous experimental result from ionization potential measurement.},

Using a model system of two parallel wires with a variable band gap, we show that this is not the case. The dispersion interaction scales as z-5 for large interwire separations z, as expected for an insulator, but as the band gap decreases the interaction is greatly enhanced; while at shorter (but nonoverlapping) separations it approaches a power-law scaling given by z-2, i.e., the dispersion interaction expected between metallic wires. We demonstrate that these effects can be understood from the increasing length scale of the plasmon modes (charge fluctuations), and their increasing contribution to the molecular dipole polarizability and the dispersion interaction, as the band gaps are reduced. This result calls into question methods which invoke locality assumptions in deriving dispersion interactions between extended small-gap systems.},

We show that the locality of the bare response function is determined by the locality of three quantities: Wannier functions of the occupied manifold, the density matrix, and the Hamiltonian matrix. In systems with a gap, the bare dielectric response is exponentially localized, which supports the physical picture of the dielectric response function as a collection of interacting local responses that can be captured by a tight-binding model.},

We here explore the energy landscapes of two unsolvated 20-residue peptides that result from a shift of the position of one amino acid in otherwise the same sequence. Our main goal is to assess the performance of current state-of-the-art density-functional theory for predicting the structure of such large and complex systems, where weak interactions such as dispersion or hydrogen bonds play a crucial role. For validation of the theoretical results, we employ experimental gas-phase ion mobility-mass spectrometry and IR spectroscopy. While unsolvated Ac-Ala19-Lys + H+ will be shown to be a clear helix seeker, the structure space of Ac-Lys-Ala19 + H+ is more complicated. Our first-principles structure-screening strategy using the dispersion-corrected PBE functional (PBE + vdWTS) identifies six distinctly different structure types competing in the low-energy regime ($\approx$16 kJ mol-1). For these structure types, we analyze the influence of the PBE and the hybrid PBE0 functional coupled with either a pairwise dispersion correction (PBE + vdWTS, PBE0 + vdWTS) or a many-body dispersion correction (PBE + MBD*, PBE0 + MBD*). We also take harmonic vibrational and rotational free energy into account. Including this, the PBE0 + MBD* functional predicts only one unique conformer to be present at 300 K. We show that this scenario is consistent with both experiments.},

  abstract = {The corrosion of materials is an undesirable and costly process affecting many areas of technology and everyday life. As such, considerable effort has gone into understanding and preventing it. Organic molecule based coatings can in certain circumstances act as effective corrosion inhibitors. Although they have been used to great effect for more than sixty years, how they function at the atomic-level is still a matter of debate. In this work, computer simulation approaches based on density functional theory are used to investigate benzotriazole (BTAH), one of the most widely used and studied corrosion inhibitors for copper. In particular, the structures formed by protonated and deprotonated BTAH molecules on Cu(111) have been determined and linked to their inhibiting properties. It is found that hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions and steric repulsions all contribute in shaping how BTAH molecules adsorb, with flat-lying structures preferred at low coverage and upright configurations preferred at high coverage. The interaction of the dehydrogenated benzotriazole molecule (BTA) with the copper surface is instead dominated by strong chemisorption via the azole moiety with the aid of copper adatoms. Structures of dimers or chains are found to be the most stable structures at all coverages, in good agreement with scanning tunnelling microscopy results. Benzotriazole thus shows a complex phase behaviour in which van der Waals forces play an important role and which depends on coverage and on its protonation state and all of these factors feasibly contribute to its effectiveness as a corrosion inhibitor.},

We find that although the interface presents a very similar structure between the two sheets, the friction coefficient on boron nitride is $\approx$3 times larger than that on graphene. This comes about because of the greater corrugation of the energy landscape on boron nitride arising from specific electronic structure effects. We discuss how a subtle dependence of the friction on the atomistic details of a surface, which is not related to its wetting properties, may have a significant impact on the transport of water at the nanoscale, with implications for the development of membranes for desalination and for osmotic power harvesting.},

Including vdW interactions in the PBE functional, on the other hand, has little influence on both structural and dynamical properties of water. Augmenting the revPBE functional with either damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections or DCACP evokes opposite behaviors. The former further softens the already under-structured revPBE water, whereas the latter makes it more glassy.

Through the transfer of protons along a hydrogen bond ``wire,'' the nascent ions separate by three or more neighbors. If the hydrogen bond wire connecting the two ions is subsequently broken, a metastable charge-separated state is visited. The ions may then diffuse to large separations. If, however, the hydrogen bond wire remains unbroken, the ions recombine rapidly.

Water molecules on the Pt surface were mostly in the O-down orientation but some H-down structures were also found. OH- ion, generated by removing H from H2O in the bulk region, moved to the Pt surface, on which a positive charge is induced, by a Grotthuss-like proton-relay mechanism and adsorbed on it as OH(Pt). Hydrogen atom exchange between OH(Pt) and a near-by water molecule frequently occurred on the Pt surface and had a low activation energy of the same order as room temperature energy. When a positive charge (7 $\mu$C cm-2) was added to the Pt surface, H3O+ and OH(Pt) were generated from 2H2O on the Pt. This may be coupled with an electron transfer to the Pt electrode [2H2O $\rightarrow$ H3O+ + OH(Pt) + e-]. The opposite reaction was also observed on the same charged surface during a simulation of duration about 10 ps; it is a reversible redox reaction. When further positive charge (14 $\mu$C cm-2) was added, the reaction shifted to the right hand side completely. Thus, this one-electron transfer reaction, which is a part of the oxygen electrode reaction in fuel cells and water electrolysis, was confirmed to be a low activation energy process.},

Radial distribution functions exhibit a loss of structure in the second solvation shell. Comparison of our results with other studies using the same empirical correction suggests the cause of the discrepancy: the Grimme dispersion correction is parameterized for use with a particular basis set; this parameterization is sensitive to this choice and, therefore, is not transferable to other basis sets.},

The obtained value of the water density is excellent (1.02 g/mL), and the calculated radial distribution functions are in fair agreement with experimental data. The MP2 results are compared to a few density functional approximations, including semilocal functionals, hybrid functionals, and functionals including empirical dispersion corrections. These results demonstrate the feasibility of directly sampling the potential energy surface of condensed-phase systems using correlated wave function theory, and their quality paves the way for further applications.},

Our results indicate that both PBE and BLYP functionals under predict the density and over structure the liquid. Adding the dispersion correction due to Grimme(1, 2) improves the predicted densities for both BLYP and PBE in a significant manner. Moreover, the addition of the dispersion correction for BLYP yields an oxygen-oxygen radial distribution function in excellent agreement with experiment. Thus, we conclude that one can obtain a very satisfactory model for water using BLYP and a correction for dispersion.},

The functional form originally proposed by Dion et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 2004, 92, 246401], with an appropriately chosen local exchange functional, yields a description of the liquid superior to that of the semilocal functional PBE. In particular, a specific choice of the local exchange functional (optB88) fitted to quantum chemistry calculations yields the best agreement with experimental results for pair correlation functions although it is slightly inferior to other van der Waals functionals in describing infrared spectra. When using optB88, liquid water displays a hydrogen-bonded network less tightly bound than when using the PBE approximation. The performance of optB88 is definitely inferior to that of the PBE0 hybrid functional for the isolated molecule but only moderately so for the liquid. However, the computational cost of optB88 is much less than that of hybrid functionals; therefore the use of optB88 appears to be a sensible alternative to calculations implying the evaluation of the Fock operator, in cases when simulations of large systems are required.},

  abstract = {Density functional theory(DFT) within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) is known to poorly reproduce the experimental properties of liquid water. The poor description of the dispersion forces in the exchange correlation functionals is one of the possible causes. Recent studies have demonstrated an improvement in the simulated properties when they are taken into account. We present here a study of the effects on liquid water of the recently proposed semi-empirical correction of Grimme et al. [J. Chem. Phys.132, 154104 (2010)]. The difference between standard and corrected DFT-GGA simulations is rationalized with a detailed analysis upon modifying an accurate parameterised potential. This allows an estimate of the typical range of dispersion forces in water. We also show that the structure and diffusivity of ambient-like liquid water are sensitive to the fifth neighbor position, thus highlighting the key role played by this neighbor. Our study is extended to water at supercritical conditions, where experimental and theoretical results are much more scarce. We show that the semi-empirical correction by Grimme et al. improves significantly, although somewhat counter-intuitively, both the structural and the dynamical description of supercritical water.},

  doi = {10.1021/jp2040345},
  abstract = {The structure of liquid water at ambient conditions is studied in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations in the NVE ensemble using van der Waals (vdW) density-functional theory, i.e., using the new exchange\textendash{}correlation functionals optPBE-vdW and vdW-DF2, where the latter has softer nonlocal correlation terms. Inclusion of the more isotropic vdW interactions counteracts highly directional hydrogen bonds, which are enhanced by standard functionals. This brings about a softening of the microscopic structure of water, as seen from the broadening of angular distribution functions and, in particular, from the much lower and broader first peak in the oxygen\textendash{}oxygen pair-correlation function (PCF) and loss of structure in the outer hydration shells. Inclusion of vdW interactions is shown to shift the balance of resulting structures from open tetrahedral to more close-packed. The resulting O\textendash{}O PCF shows some resemblance with experiment for high-density water (Soper, A. K. and Ricci, M. A.Phys. Rev. Lett. 2000, 84, 2881), but not directly with experiment for ambient water. Considering the accuracy of the new functionals for interaction energies, we investigate whether the simulation protocol could cause the deviation. An O\textendash{}O PCF consisting of a linear combination of 70\% from vdW-DF2 and 30\% from low-density liquid water, as extrapolated from experiments, reproduces near-quantitatively the experimental O\textendash{}O PCF for ambient water. This suggests the possibility that the new functionals may be reliable and that instead larger-scale simulations in the NPT ensemble, where the density is allowed to fluctuate in accordance with proposals for supercooled water, could resolve the apparent discrepancy with the measured PCF.},

For H 2 O/D 2 O the translational and rotational IE are clearly distinct. At 298 K, 23\% and 30\% are obtained, respectively. Both effects as well as the slopes of the temperature dependencies increase with decreasing temperature. For NH 3 / ND 3 a rotational IE of 37\% was observed at 298 K. A small increase to 40\% at 222 K could be ascertained. The translational IE is about 15\% at room temperature and exhibits a stronger temperature dependence. It is suggested that the observed deviations of the IE's from the square root of mass and square root of moments of inertia laws are caused by translation-rotation coupling as well as quantum effects. The experimental data obtained in the present paper are also of importance for the correct interpretation of all kinds of experiments on water and ammonia, where isotopic substitutions are involved.},

The identification of a general class of plasmonic excitations in systems containing only a few dozen atoms permits us to extend this versatility into the visible and ultraviolet. As appealing as this extension might be for active nanoscale manipulation of visible light, its realization constitutes a formidable technical challenge. We experimentally demonstrate the existence of molecular plasmon resonances in the visible for ionized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which we reversibly switch by adding, then removing, a single electron from the molecule. The charged PAHs display intense absorption in the visible regime with electrical and geometrical tunability analogous to the plasmonic resonances of much larger nanographene systems. Finally, we also use the switchable molecular plasmon in anthracene to demonstrate a proof-of-concept low-voltage electrochromic device.},

The resultant SCAN+rVV10 is the only vdW density functional to date that yields excellent interlayer binding energies and spacings, as well as intralayer lattice constants in 28 layered materials. Its versatility for various kinds of bonding is further demonstrated by its good performance for 22 interactions between molecules; the cohesive energies and lattice constants of 50 solids; the adsorption energy and distance of a benzene molecule on coinage-metal surfaces; the binding energy curves for graphene on Cu(111), Ni(111), and Co(0001) surfaces; and the rare-gas solids. We argue that a good semilocal approximation should (as SCAN does) capture the intermediate-range vdW through its exchange term. We have found an effective range of the vdW interaction between 8 and 16 {\AA} for systems considered here, suggesting that this interaction is negligibly small at the larger distances where it reaches its asymptotic power-law decay.},

The method is illustrated by rederiving the Lifshitz formula for infinite half-spaces, by demonstrating the Casimir-Polder to van der Waals crossover, and by computing the Casimir interaction energy of two infinite, parallel, perfect metal cylinders either inside or outside one another. Furthermore, it is used to obtain new results, namely, the Casimir energies of a sphere or a cylinder opposite a plate, all with finite permittivity and permeability, to leading order at large separation.},

A double Lorentzian oscillator is used to describe the frequency-dependent atomic polarizabilities, while a single Lorentzian oscillator is used to describe the frequency-dependent atomic capacitances. All atomic parameters have been optimized using reference data obtained from time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. As a comprehensive test of our model, we have studied the frequency-dependent polarizabilities of quasi-spherical silver nanoclusters having different structural motifs, i.e., icosahedra, truncated Ino and Marks decahedra, and regular truncated octahedra and cubocahedra. We have shown that clusters in all five structural motifs exhibit a strong absorption peak in the spectral region of 2.4-4.8 eV, although the size evolution of absorption peak location and peak width depends strongly on the number of atoms and the atomic arrangements of the clusters.},

For an infinite barrier model, the local density approximation gives a surface exchange energy 50\% greater than the exact value, a large and previously unsuspected error. An exact evaluation of the surface correlation energy is not feasible, but the authors argue that the dominant contribution, arising from the difference in zero point energy between bounded and unbounded systems, can be estimated using a simple model.

Such interactions are important not only for the fundamental science of materials behavior, but also for the design and improvement of micro- and nanostructured devices. In the past decade, many new materials have become available, which has stimulated the need for understanding their dispersive interactions. The field of van der Waals and Casimir forces has experienced an impetus in terms of developing novel theoretical and computational methods to provide new insights into related phenomena. The understanding of such forces has far reaching consequences as it bridges concepts in materials, atomic and molecular physics, condensed-matter physics, high-energy physics, chemistry, and biology. This review summarizes major breakthroughs and emphasizes the common origin of van der Waals and Casimir interactions. Progress related to novel ab initio modeling approaches and their application in various systems, interactions in materials with Dirac-like spectra, force manipulations through nontrivial boundary conditions, and applications of van der Waals forces in organic and biological matter are examined. The outlook of the review is to give the scientific community a materials perspective of van der Waals and Casimir phenomena and stimulate the development of experimental techniques and applications.},

We show, using confined atoms covering rows 1-5 of the periodic table, that C6/C6R$\approx$(V/VR)pZ and $\alpha$/$\alpha$R$\approx$(V/VR)pZ${'}$ (for volume V=$\int$dr4$\uppi$3r3n(r)), where C6R, $\alpha$R, and VR are the reference values and effective volume of the free atom. The scaling exponents pZ and pZ${'}$ vary substantially as a function of element number Z = N, in contrast to the standard ``rule of thumb'' that pZ = 2 and pZ${'}$=1. Remarkably, we find that the polarizability and C 6 exponents p${'}$ and p are related by p${'}$ $\approx$ p - 0.615 rather than the expected p${'}$ $\approx$ p/2. Results are largely independent of the form of the confining potential (harmonic, cubic, and quartic potentials are considered) and kernel approximation, justifying this analysis.},

For simple systems, the new energy density is calculated exactly, and compared with traditional choices, on both formal and physical grounds. Finally, the energy densities of both the gradient expansion and the von Weizs{\"a}cker approximation are calculated, and compared with the exact quantity.

  abstract = {Dynamic dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities as well as shielding factors of the beryllium atom in the ground state were computed at real frequencies by using the variation-perturbation method. The zeroth- and the first-order wave functions were expanded in many-electron basis of exponentially correlated Gaussian functions. The 1600-term expansion of the unperturbed wave function yielded the ground-state energy accurate to 1cm-1. The first-order wave functions were expanded in very large bases (4800 and 4400 terms). The nonlinear parameters of the first-order correction functions were optimized with respect to both the static and dynamic polarizabilities, and with respect to the excited-state energies. The procedure employed ensures a high accuracy of determination of dynamic properties in a wide range of frequencies and correct positions of the transition poles. Test calculations, performed on He and Li, confirmed the ability of this method to obtain the atomic properties with very high accuracy. The final values of the static properties of Be were 37.755e2a20E-1H and 300.96e2a40E-1H for the dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities, respectively, and 1.4769 for the quadrupole shielding factor. The convergence of the atomic properties with the size of the expansion of both the zeroth- and first-order functions was checked. Thanks to very high accuracy of the unperturbed wave function and the efficient method of construction of the first-order wave functions, the dynamic polarizability results presented in this work are of benchmark quality. As a by-product of this project, a set of the most accurate upper bounds to the energies of 1P and 1D states of Be was obtained.},

Both effects are found to be of importance and, when included, lead to satisfactory agreement with available experimental data on dipole polarizabilities. The influence of consistency effects is always found to reduce the polarizabilities with respect to the free ions while the influence of the crystal environment leads to a decrease for anions and an increase for cations. Comparison is also made for free ions with experimental results, and with theoretical results from other approaches to focus on the accuracy of calculated consistency contributions.

  abstract = {The concept of the atomic charge is extensively used to model the electrostatic properties of proteins. Atomic charges are not only the basis for the electrostatic energy term in biomolecular force fields but are also derived from quantum mechanical computations on protein fragments to get more insight into their electronic structure. Unfortunately there are many atomic charge schemes which lead to significantly different results, and it is not trivial to determine which scheme is most suitable for biomolecular studies. Therefore, we present an extensive methodological benchmark using a selection of atomic charge schemes [Mulliken, natural, restrained electrostatic potential, Hirshfeld-I, electronegativity equalization method (EEM), and split-charge equilibration (SQE)] applied to two sets of penta-alanine conformers. Our analysis clearly shows that Hirshfeld-I charges offer the best compromise between transferability (robustness with respect to conformational changes) and the ability to reproduce electrostatic properties of the penta-alanine. The benchmark also considers two charge equilibration models (EEM and SQE), which both clearly fail to describe the locally charged moieties in the zwitterionic form of penta-alanine. This issue is analyzed in detail because charge equilibration models are computationally much more attractive than the Hirshfeld-I scheme. Based on the latter analysis, a straightforward extension of the SQE model is proposed, SQE+Q0, that is suitable to describe biological systems bearing many locally charged functional groups.},

  abstract = {One atom or molecule binds to another through various types of bond, the strengths of which range from several meV to several eV. Although some computational methods can provide accurate descriptions of all bond types, those methods are not efficient enough for many studies (for example, large systems, ab initio molecular dynamics and high-throughput searches for functional materials). Here, we show that the recently developed non-empirical strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) within the density functional theory framework predicts accurate geometries and energies of diversely bonded molecules and materials (including covalent, metallic, ionic, hydrogen and van der Waals bonds). This represents a significant improvement at comparable efficiency over its predecessors, the GGAs that currently dominate materials computation. Often, SCAN matches or improves on the accuracy of a computationally expensive hybrid functional, at almost-GGA cost. SCAN is therefore expected to have a broad impact on chemistry and materials science.

A previous study of BH concerning FCI benchmarking has been extended to include CC3 and static CCSDT values. Systematic improvements of the polarizabilities and the hyperpolarizabilities are found going from CCS to CCSD and from CCSD to CC3 or CCSDT. Little or no improvement of the polarizabilities and no improvement of the hyperpolarizabilities are seen when going from CCS to CC2. The CCSD results represent a significant improvement over CCS and CC2 but are again surpassed by the CC3 results which agree very well with the FCI values.

  abstract = {The random phase approximation to the correlation energy often yields highly accurate results for condensed matter systems. However, ways how to improve its accuracy are being sought and here we explore the relevance of singles contributions for prototypical solid state systems. We set out with a derivation of the random phase approximation using the adiabatic connection and fluctuation dissipation theorem, but contrary to the most commonly used derivation, the density is allowed to vary along the coupling constant integral. This yields results closely paralleling standard perturbation theory. We re-derive the standard singles of G{\"o}rling-Levy perturbation theory [A. G{\"o}rling and M. Levy, Phys. Rev. A 50, 196 (1994)], highlight the analogy of our expression to the renormalized singles introduced by Ren and coworkers [Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 153003 (2011)], and introduce a new approximation for the singles using the density matrix in the random phase approximation. We discuss the physical relevance and importance of singles alongside illustrative examples of simple weakly bonded systems, including rare gas solids (Ne, Ar, Xe), ice, adsorption of water on NaCl, and solid benzene. The effect of singles on covalently and metallically bonded systems is also discussed.},

We report gCP results compared to those from the standard Boys\textendash{}Bernardi counterpoise correction scheme and large basis set calculations. The applicability of the method to molecular crystals as the main target is tested for the benchmark set X23. It consists of 23 noncovalently bound crystals as introduced by Johnson et al. (J. Chem. Phys. 2012, 137, 054103) and refined by Tkatchenko et al. (J. Chem. Phys. 2013, 139, 024705). In order to accurately describe long-range electron correlation effects, we use the standard atom-pairwise dispersion correction scheme DFT-D3. We show that a combination of DFT energies with small atom-centered basis sets, the D3 dispersion correction, and the gCP correction can accurately describe van der Waals and hydrogen-bonded crystals. Mean absolute deviations of the X23 sublimation energies can be reduced by more than 70\% and 80\% for the standard functionals PBE and B3LYP, respectively, to small residual mean absolute deviations of about 2 kcal/mol (corresponding to 13\% of the average sublimation energy). As a further test, we compute the interlayer interaction of graphite for varying distances and obtain a good equilibrium distance and interaction energy of 6.75 {\AA} and -43.0 meV/atom at the PBE-D3-gCP/SVP level. We fit the gCP scheme for a recently developed pob-TZVP solid-state basis set and obtain reasonable results for the X23 benchmark set and the potential energy curve for water adsorption on a nickel (110) surface.},

  abstract = {Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) has become established as an indispensable tool for investigating aqueous systems of all kinds, including those important in chemistry, surface science, biology, and the earth sciences. Nevertheless, many widely used approximations for the exchange-correlation (XC) functional describe the properties of pure water systems with an accuracy that is not fully satisfactory. The explicit inclusion of dispersion interactions generally improves the description, but there remain large disagreements between the predictions of different dispersion-inclusive methods. We present here a review of DFT work on water clusters, ice structures, and liquid water, with the aim of elucidating how the strengths and weaknesses of different XC approximations manifest themselves across this variety of water systems. Our review highlights the crucial role of dispersion in describing the delicate balance between compact and extended structures of many different water systems, including the liquid. By referring to a wide range of published work, we argue that the correct description of exchange-overlap interactions is also extremely important, so that the choice of semi-local or hybrid functional employed in dispersion-inclusive methods is crucial. The origins and consequences of beyond-2-body errors of approximate XC functionals are noted, and we also discuss the substantial differences between different representations of dispersion. We propose a simple numerical scoring system that rates the performance of different XC functionals in describing water systems, and we suggest possible future developments.},

It can be viewed as underlying such important ideas as Pauling's ``chemical bond,'' ``transferability,'' and Yang's computational principle of ``divide and conquer.'' It describes the fact that, for fixed chemical potential, local electronic properties, such as the density n(r), depend significantly on the effective external potential only at nearby points. Changes of that potential, no matter how large, beyond a distance R have limited effects on local electronic properties, which rapidly tend to zero as a function of R. In the present paper, the concept is first sharpened for representative models of uncharged fermions moving in external potentials, and then the effects of electron\textendash{}electron interactions and of perturbing external charges are discussed.},

Lett. 115, 036402 (2015)] obeys all 17 known exact constraints for meta-generalized-gradient approximations (meta-GGAs), and it includes some medium-range correlation effects. Long-range London dispersion interactions are still missing, but they can be accounted for via an appropriate correction scheme. In this study, we combine SCAN with an efficient London dispersion correction and show that lattice energies of simple organic crystals can be improved with the applied correction by 50\%. The London-dispersion corrected SCAN meta-GGA outperforms all other tested London-dispersion corrected meta-GGAs for molecular geometries. Our method yields mean absolute deviations (MADs) for main group bond lengths that are consistently below 1 pm, rotational constants with MADs of 0.2\%, and noncovalent distances with MADs below 1\%. For a large database of general main group thermochemistry and kinetics ($\sim$800 chemical species), one of the lowest weighted mean absolute deviations for long-range corrected meta-GGA functionals is achieved. Noncovalent interactions are of average quality, and hydrogen bonded systems in particular seem to suffer from overestimated polarization related to the self-interaction error of SCAN. We also discuss some consequences of numerical sensitivity encountered for meta-GGAs.},

One must therefore resort to approximate methods. The best of these is Hartree's method of the self-consistent field. Even this, however, is hardly practicable when one has to deal with very many electrons, so that one then requires a still simpler and rougher method. Such a method is provided by Thomas' atomic model, in which the electrons are regarded as forming a perfect gas satisfying the Fermi statistics and occupying the region of phase space of lowest energy. This region of phase space is assumed to be saturated, with two electrons with opposite spins in each volume (2$\uppi$h)3, and the remainder is assumed to be empty. Although this model hitherto has not been justified theoretically, it seems to be a plausible approximation for the interior of a heavy atom and one may expect it to give with some accuracy the distribution of electric charge there.},

We demonstrate this approach with a form of tensor network state, and use it to find solutions to the strongly correlated Hubbard model, as well as its application to a fully periodic ab initio graphene sheet. The number of variables which can be simultaneously optimized greatly exceeds alternative formulations of variational Monte Carlo methods, allowing for systematic improvability of the wave function flexibility towards exactness for a number of different forms, while blurring the line between traditional variational and projector quantum Monte Carlo approaches.},

Particular attention is paid to the intriguing nature of many-body vdW interactions, whose fundamental relevance has recently been highlighted in several landmark experiments. The performance of these models in predicting binding energetics as well as structural, electronic, and thermodynamic properties is connected with the theoretical concepts and provides a numerical summary of the state-of-the-art in the field.

However, the interpretation of the experiments has been questioned and the stability of square ice has become a matter of debate. Partially this is because the simulation approaches employed so far (force fields and density functional theory) struggle to accurately describe the very small energy differences between the relevant phases. Here we report a study of 2D ice using an accurate wave-function based electronic structure approach, namely diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC). We find that at relatively high pressure, square ice is indeed the lowest enthalpy phase examined, supporting the initial experimental claim. Moreover, at lower pressures, a ``pentagonal ice'' phase (not yet observed experimentally) has the lowest enthalpy, and at ambient pressure, the ``pentagonal ice'' phase is degenerate with a ``hexagonal ice'' phase. Our DMC results also allow us to evaluate the accuracy of various density functional theory exchange-correlation functionals and force field models, and in doing so we extend the understanding of how such methodologies perform to challenging 2D structures presenting dangling hydrogen bonds.},

  title = {Effect of the Damping Function in Dispersion Corrected Density Functional Theory},
  volume = {32},
  doi = {10.1002/jcc.21759},
  abstract = {It is shown by an extensive benchmark on molecular energy data that the mathematical form of the damping function in DFT-D methods has only a minor impact on the quality of the results. For 12 different functionals, a standard ``zero-damping'' formula and rational damping to finite values for small interatomic distances according to Becke and Johnson (BJ-damping) has been tested. The same (DFT-D3) scheme for the computation of the dispersion coefficients is used. The BJ-damping requires one fit parameter more for each functional (three instead of two) but has the advantage of avoiding repulsive interatomic forces at shorter distances. With BJ-damping better results for nonbonded distances and more clear effects of intramolecular dispersion in four representative molecular structures are found. For the noncovalently-bonded structures in the S22 set, both schemes lead to very similar intermolecular distances. For noncovalent interaction energies BJ-damping performs slightly better but both variants can be recommended in general. The exception to this is Hartree-Fock that can be recommended only in the BJ-variant and which is then close to the accuracy of corrected GGAs for non-covalent interactions. According to the thermodynamic benchmarks BJ-damping is more accurate especially for medium-range electron correlation problems and only small and practically insignificant double-counting effects are observed. It seems to provide a physically correct short-range behavior of correlation/dispersion even with unmodified standard functionals. In any case, the differences between the two methods are much smaller than the overall dispersion effect and often also smaller than the influence of the underlying density functional. \textcopyright{} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

These methods are exact for systems of slowly varying or high density. For the ground state, they lead to self-consistent equations analogous to the Hartree and Hartree-Fock equations, respectively. In these equations the exchange and correlation portions of the chemical potential of a uniform electron gas appear as additional effective potentials. (The exchange portion of our effective potential differs from that due to Slater by a factor of 23.) Electronic systems at finite temperatures and in magnetic fields are also treated by similar methods.

Grimme's DFT-D3 correction can solve this problem partially; however, double-counting of medium-range electron correlation can occur. For the related M06-L functional, the alternative VV10 van der Waals kernel is tested, but it experiences similar double-counting. Most functionals give unphysical dissociation curves for the argon dimer, an indication for method-inherent problems, and further investigation is recommended. These results are further evidence that the London-dispersion problem in density functional theory approximations is unlikely to be solved by mere empirical optimization of functional parameters, unless the functionals contain components that ensure the correct asymptotic long-range behavior. London dispersion is ubiquitous, which is why the reported findings are not only important for theoreticians but also a reminder to the general chemist to carefully consider their choice of method before undertaking computational studies.},

Such a theory is especially important when considering vdW interactions at mesoscopic scales, i.e., between molecules and structured surfaces with features on the scale of molecular sizes, in which case the finite sizes, complex shapes, and resulting nonlocal electronic excitations of molecules are strongly influenced by electromagnetic retardation and wave effects that depend crucially on the shapes of surrounding macroscopic bodies. We show that these effects together can modify vdW interaction energies and forces, as well as molecular shapes deformed by vdW interactions, by orders of magnitude compared to previous treatments based on Casimir-Polder, nonretarded, or pairwise approximations, which are valid only at macroscopically large or atomic-scale separations or in dilute insulating media, respectively.},

However, the gap in the band structure of the exact multiplicative Kohn\textendash{}Sham (KS) potential substantially underestimates the fundamental gap, a major limitation of KS density-functional theory. Here, we give a simple proof of a theorem: In generalized KS theory (GKS), the band gap of an extended system equals the fundamental gap for the approximate functional if the GKS potential operator is continuous and the density change is delocalized when an electron or hole is added. Our theorem explains how GKS band gaps from metageneralized gradient approximations (meta-GGAs) and hybrid functionals can be more realistic than those from GGAs or even from the exact KS potential. The theorem also follows from earlier work. The band edges in the GKS one-electron spectrum are also related to measurable energies. A linear chain of hydrogen molecules, solid aluminum arsenide, and solid argon provide numerical illustrations.},

  abstract = {A calculation of van der Waal's potential of two atoms at large separation has been carried out for hydrogen and helium. The method depends upon a representation of the perturbed wave function of the system as $\psi$=$\psi$0 (1+vR) where $\psi$0 is the unperturbed wave function, v the perturbing potential and R is a function of the radial coordinates of the electrons. The method is equally well adapted to the calculation of polarizabilities. A computation of the mutual energy of two hydrogen atoms confirms the results of Eisenschitz and London. The polarizability of helium is calculated as 0.210\texttimes{}10-24 cc which agrees well with the experimental value, 0.205\texttimes{}10-24. The mutual energy of two helium atoms is found to be -3.18 E0(Ra0)6. A correlation between the mutual energy of the two molecules, $\epsilon$, and the polarizability, $\alpha$, is obtained: $\epsilon$=-1.36$\nu$012a032a32E0R6 where $\nu$0 is the number of electrons in the highest quantum state in the molecule, E0 the energy of the hydrogen atom in the normal state, and R is the separation of the molecules. By means of this formula, the van der Waals cohesive pressure constant is calculated for Ne, A, N2, H2, O2, and CH4.},

  abstract = {The influence of retardation on the energy of interaction between two neutral atoms is investigated by means of quantum electrodynamics. As a preliminary step, Part I contains a discussion of the interaction between a neutral atom and a perfectly conducting plane, and it is found that the influence of retardation leads to a reduction of the interaction energy by a correction factor which decreases monotonically with increasing distance R. This factor is equal to unity for R small compared with the wave-lengths corresponding to the atomic frequencies, and is proportional to R-1 for distances large compared with these wave-lengths. In the latter case the total interaction energy is given by -3$\hslash$c$\alpha$8$\uppi$R4, where $\alpha$ is the static polarizability of the atom. Although the problem of the interaction of two atoms discussed in Part II is much more difficult to handle mathematically, the results are very similar. Again the influence of retardation can be described by a monotonically decreasing correction factor which is equal to unity for small distances and proportional to R-1 for large distances. In the latter case the energy of interaction is found to be -23$\hslash$c$\alpha$1$\alpha$24$\uppi$R7.},

The contact resembles that between a sphere and a flat. The mica sheets are glued to glass formers, their concave face being first slightly silvered. The contact region and the distance of approach are measured by multiple beam interferometry using fringes of equal chromatic order (f. e. c. o.). This gives an accuracy for the distances between the surfaces of $\pm$ 0.3 nm. Since the surfaces are molecularly smooth it is possible to bring them very close to one another. One surface is held on a rigid support, the other on a light cantilever beam. The surfaces are slowly brought together and at a critical separation `flick' together. The `flick' distance depends on the stiffness of the cantilever and this in turn provides a direct measure of the surface forces. By using cantilevers of different stiffnesses the method has proved effective for separations ranging from 5 to 30 nm. The results show that for separations less than about 10 nm the forces operating are `normal' van der Waals forces whilst for distances greater than 20 nm they are `retarded' van der Waals forces.},

  abstract = {An intermolecular potential was derived from ab initio calculations on methanol dimers and trimers. Ninety-four methanol dimer geometries and seventeen trimer geometries have been studied using an interaction-optimized basis set. Because we aimed at transferability, all terms of the model were fitted separately, in order to obtain a potential in which these energy terms have a well-defined physical meaning. Electrostatic interactions were described by atomic multipole moments obtained by fitting to the monomer electrostatic potential. The polarization energy was modeled using atomic dipole polarizabilities. Scaled empirical polarizabilities reproduced the energy nonadditivity in methanol trimers very accurately. The dispersion energy was described by a damped r-6 atom-atom potential, which was fitted to separately calculated dispersion energies. Exchange energy and remaining short-ranged terms were modeled by an exponential repulsion term, including some anisotropic features. This repulsion model was fitted to the total SCF+MP2 interaction energies of the dimers. The maximum deviation for near-equilibrium geometries was $\sim$0.2 kcal/mol. The calculated interaction energies for dimers containing methane, water, and dimethyl ether were in similar agreement, both with our own ab initio calculations and with the best values available in the literature. In addition, trends in hydrogen-bond distances in these dimers and in methanol trimers were well reproduced by our model. So, the potential was seen to be transferable to related systems.},

  volume = {76},
  abstract = {Universal variational functionals of densities, first-order density matrices, and natural spin-orbitals are explicitly displayed for variational calculations of ground states of interacting electrons in atoms, molecules, and solids. In all cases, the functionals search for constrained minima. In particular, following Percus [Formula: see text] is identified as the universal functional of Hohenberg and Kohn for the sum of the kinetic and electron\textemdash{}electron repulsion energies of an N-representable trial electron density $\rho$. Q[$\rho$] searches all antisymmetric wavefunctions $\Psi\rho$ which yield the fixed. $\rho$. Q[$\rho$] then delivers that expectation value which is a minimum. Similarly, [Formula: see text] is shown to be the universal functional for the electron\textemdash{}electron repulsion energy of an N-representable trial first-order density matrix $\gamma$, where the actual external potential may be nonlocal as well as local. These universal functions do not require that a trial function for a variational calculation be associated with a ground state of some external potential. Thus, the v-representability problem, which is especially severe for trial first-order density matrices, has been solved. Universal variational functionals in Hartree\textemdash{}Fock and other restricted wavefunction theories are also presented. Finally, natural spin-orbital functional theory is compared with traditional orbital formulations in density functional theory.},

The instability occurs for spin-density waves having a wave vector Q$\approx$2kF, the diameter of the Fermi sphere. It follows that the (Hartree-Fock) spin susceptibility of the paramagnetic state is not a monotonic decreasing function with increasing Q, but rather a function with a singularity near Q=2kF. Rather convincing experimental evidence that the antiferromagnetic ground state of chromium is a large-amplitude spin density wave state is summarized. A number of consequences of such states are discussed, including the problem of detecting them by neutron diffraction.},

  abstract = {We propose a simple analytic representation of the correlation energy $\varepsilon$c for a uniform electron gas, as a function of density parameter rs and relative spin polarization $\zeta$. Within the random-phase approximation (RPA), this representation allows for the r-3/4s behavior as rs$\rightarrow\infty$. Close agreement with numerical RPA values for $\varepsilon$c(rs,0), $\varepsilon$c(rs,1), and the spin stiffness $\alpha$c(rs)=$\partial$2$\varepsilon$c(rs, $\zeta$=0)/$\delta\zeta$2, and recovery of the correct rslnrs term for rs$\rightarrow$0, indicate the appropriateness of the chosen analytic form. Beyond RPA, different parameters for the same analytic form are found by fitting to the Green's-function Monte Carlo data of Ceperley and Alder [Phys. Rev. Lett. 45, 566 (1980)], taking into account data uncertainties that have been ignored in earlier fits by Vosko, Wilk, and Nusair (VWN) [Can. J.

While we confirm the practical accuracy of the VWN and PZ representations, we eliminate some minor problems with these forms. We study the $\zeta$-dependent coefficients in the high- and low-density expansions, and the rs-dependent spin susceptibility. We also present a conjecture for the exact low-density limit. The correlation potential $\mu\sigma$c(rs,$\zeta$) is evaluated for use in self-consistent density-functional calculations.},

Discrepancies between the results of different methods of calculation are resolved and some shape-dependent effects are discussed briefly. In a simulation under these periodic boundary conditions, the net Hamiltonian contains a positive term proportional to the square of the net dipole moment of the configuration. Surrounding the infinite sphere by a continuum of dielectric constant $\epsilon$.' changes this positive term, the coefficient being zero as $\epsilon$' -$>\infty$ . We report on the simulation of a dense fluid of hard spheres with embedded point dipoles; simulations are made for different values of showing how the Kirkwood gr-factor and the long-range part of hA (r) depend on $\epsilon$' in a finite simulation. We show how this dependence on $\epsilon$' nonetheless leads to a dielectric constant for the system that is independent of $\epsilon$ . In particular, the Clausius-Mosotti and Kirkwood formulae for the dielectric constant e of the system give consistent $\epsilon$ values.},

  abstract = {Within density functional theory, a coordinate-scaling relation for the coupling-constant dependence of the exchange-correlation kernel fxc(r,r${'}$;$\omega$) is utilized to express the correlation energy of a many-electron system in terms of fxc. As a test of several of the available approximations for the exchange-correlation kernel, or equivalently the local-field factor, we calculate the uniform-gas correlation energy. While the random phase approximation (fxc = 0) makes the correlation energy per electron too negative by about 0.5 eV, the adiabatic local-density approximation [fxc = fxc(q = 0,$\omega$ = 0)] makes a comparable error in the opposite direction. The adiabatic nonlocal approximation [fxc = fxc(q,$\omega$ = 0)] reduces this error to about 0.1 eV, and inclusion of the full frequency dependence [fxc = fxc(q,$\omega$)] in an approximate parametrization reduces it further to less than 0.02 eV. We also report the wave-vector analysis and the imaginary-frequency analysis of the correlation energy for each choice of kernel.},

  abstract = {We present a complete 6-dimensional potential energy surface for the benzene dimer obtained using symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) of intermolecular interactions based on Kohn-Sham's description of monomers. Ab initio calculations were performed for 491 dimer geometries in a triple-$\zeta$-quality basis set supplemented by bond functions. An accurate analytic fit to the ab initio results has been developed and low-energy stationary points on the potential energy surface have been found. We have determined that there are three minima on the surface. Two of them, the tilted T-shape and the parallel-displaced, are nearly isoenergetic with interaction energies of -2.77 and -2.74 kcal/mol, respectively. The third minimum, a twisted edge-to-edge conformation, is significantly less attractive, with the interaction energy equal to -1.82 kcal/mol. Both the T-shape and sandwich geometries, sometimes assumed to be minima, are shown to be only saddle points. The potential energy surface is extremely flat between the two lowest minima, the barrier being only 0.10 kcal/mol above the global minimum. The second-virial coefficient obtained with the new potential agrees well with experimental results over a wide range of temperatures. The SAPT approach rigorously decomposes the interaction energy into physical components. The relative importance of these components has been analyzed.},

  abstract = {We describe a numerical method to compute Casimir forces in arbitrary geometries, for arbitrary dielectric and metallic materials, with arbitrary accuracy (given sufficient computational resources). Our approach, based on well-established integration of the mean stress tensor evaluated via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, is designed to directly exploit fast methods developed for classical computational electromagnetism, since it only involves repeated evaluation of the Green's function for imaginary frequencies (equivalently, real frequencies in imaginary time). We develop the approach by systematically examining various formulations of Casimir forces from the previous decades and evaluating them according to their suitability for numerical computation. We illustrate our approach with a simple finite-difference frequency-domain implementation, test it for known geometries such as a cylinder and a plate, and apply it to new geometries. In particular, we show that a pistonlike geometry of two squares sliding between metal walls, in both two and three dimensions with both perfect and realistic metallic materials, exhibits a surprising nonmonotonic ``lateral'' force from the walls.},
